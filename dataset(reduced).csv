 POV Tag Vandalism? 

David Starr has re-posted the POV alert tag on this page. I do not feel he ever fully addressed my questions. He is asserting that the page shows overwhelming bias in some way - according to him there are only two specific single line instances that he cites of bias on the page, both in the bio. This does not a biased page make.

I have clearly refuted both of these claims at length, with no response (despite repeated requests) from Starr. 

1) The """"garbage"""" passage is balanced with an explanation from a Da spokesperson. The source is quoted, phrase is neutral, and source (scholar Georg Feuerstein) is not in dispute by Starr. The mention is crucial because it explains the """"controversial"""" aspect in first line of lead, and period is alluded to in Adidam apologies for """"controversial"""" earlier behavior and in the numbers of lawsuits, news articles, and analysis by authorities linked to and discussed in Da page. Also, further explained by Da himself in """"Crazy Wisdom"""" section in teaching.

2) Mention of 1986 breakdown/Divine Emergence. This is a significant event, as attested by Adi Da press. Source is not biased, all mentions of events are phrased neutrally within basic journalistic standards. Balanced with Adi Da self-assessment as personally significant event (about which an entire book was written.)

3)""""Undue weight"""" was shown to be unreasonable, as each line is short without subjective exposition. On balance throughout page, all potentially """"controversial"""" material (in every case sourced, cited, and neutrally phrased) is far outweighed by neutral info and Da """"self-assessment."""" 

Every potentially controversial mention is carefully contextualized and phrased to reflect source, and balanced with an alternate explanation. In every case. 

Source disputes:
1) Gurdjieff Journal: no specific instances of bias are alleged by Starr from this source. Starr is simply questioning the source without saying why it is an issue. Did not address my point that source is only used because it summarizes bio info from Da, Rudi, and Siddha Yoga accounts. No bias is reflected in WP entry, no has any been revealed. And Starr has failed to show how magazine is biased or """"self-published"""" simply making assertion that it is a """"competing religious organization"""" which is simply unproven (there is no Gurdjieff church or """"organization"""").

2) Lake County News: source has been used for other articles, Starr only questions it for single mention that he subjectively finds to his dislike (the Divine Emergence passage). He has not worked to find alternative source that would allow the material about a significant event to remain. Source has been found acceptable to all other editors in past months, as demonstrated by its repeated use. Starr cannot singly enter now and discount source, when not showing WP guideline that effectively discounts it (only his own subjective analysis of the quality of the """"contact"""" page on their website.)

All other editors, including myself, have been involved in give an take on this page, making allowances and corrections for each other - even yesterday I made changes to accommodate other editors, including Starr. I do not feel that Starr is meeting this standard, and in particular completely failed to address my repeated specific requests. Because of this, I am removing the POV tag as vandalism and an attempt to discount page. I have requested third party review, and perhaps further dispute resolution.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Comparing bronze apples to fresh sprouts 
Ah, so now you spring your little argument youve been itching for a while to do. In otherwords, 'How can Wikipedia support the supernatural claims in the Bible, and not those in my particular brand new religion.' 

First of all, Wikipedia doesnt support anything. Articles are to be written NPOV - that doesnt mean that articles dont ever use Biblespeak, rather when it is used, its used in proper context: """"In the Bible, etc. etc."""" 
This is not the Schucmanism Encyclopedia. Even if the claim that Jesus wrote the thing was universal among Christians, this is not the Christian Encyclopedia.  

Im not particularly attached to the term ghostwriting, but your wording - that [whatever it was called] is like channeling, etc - was not neutral, and placed too much emphasis on a trivial matter - trivial, because supernatural claims, despite our understanding of them in faith, are not encyclopedically substantive. 
This is of course the problem with religion - a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and a lot of knowledge of just one thing is just plain dogma. You seem to be asserting that there is a dogmatic bias in wikipedia regarding the Bible. Its interesting, but you need to poing out specific examples, and then you need to deal with them on a case by case basis. Maybe you have a point here - I cant tell ATP. Dont forget """"the log in your own"""" BTW.

Its obviously a very touchy subject, but we deal from time to time with people seeking to push a POV in their writing, and after a while they realize that theyve already added all the information necessary to the article, but leave the writing to others. Its an important distinction - I myself have a couple times had to defer to others sometimes in cases where a conflict arose between two different POV writing styles. The question is: are yours and mine different enought to require outside help in resolving any dispute. Finally, """"Ill let you..."""" doesnt work here - its not your article, though you have had more part than anyone in developing it. And I was simply rewriting it for sake of neutral tone - something which you should welcome, not reject - as it legitimizes and adds to your work, just as your work adds to the project.

1. Wal-Mart does not spend as much on insurance as other companies.

The fact. Yes Wal-Mart spends less per work for health.

The Twist. What they forget to say is that Wal-Mart does not buy insurance at 
all, it puts that money into a bank account, where it collects interest, it then contracts Blue Cross to admin the fund. 

The reality. Wal-Mart gives better insurance than most other retailers. 
Want to see for yourself go to your local walmart and get an assocate guide.

2. Wal-Mart does not supply as many with healthcare.

The fact. Yes on a percentage base Wal-Mart only 47% are covered.

The Twist. What critics don't tell you is that Wal-Mart offers Star Bridge health from day one, and that wal-mart has 1.6 million Workers with a larger turn over rate, so this leads to a lower percentage of works covered.

3. Wal-Mart has a high turn over rate.

The Fact. Wal-Mart does have a high turn over rate.

The Twist. Critics Site Wal-Mart as the reason, however most of people that leave walmart site customer related stress. And the area of walmart that has the highest turn over is also the largest pool of workers, cashiers. Plain and simple the customers run the cashiers out. And who can blame them think of all the people in the world you could not stand, and they deal with them all everyday.

4. Wal-Mart has more workers on state healthcare than any other company.

The Fact. Yes wal-mart does have more works on state healthcare.

The Twist. Critics argue that due to the number of workers on state healthcare is single handedly causing problems for many state healthcare,however what they forget to say is that Walmart pays 70 Billion dollars in federal taxes and nearly that again in state taxes and also generate billions of dollars in sales tax for each state with sales tax,which far out does the money spend buy the state on healthcare for wal-mart assocates. And many of the assocates that quilify for state aided healthcare also would quailify for welfare if they did not work for walmart. And would most likely be on both if they worked for a smaller ma and pa shop, that could not afford to supply any benefits. 

5. Wal-mart buys large quantities from china

The Fact Yes walmart buys a lot from china.

The Twist Critics argue that Walmart alone is the primary reason for US jobs being exported, however what they fail to say is that walmart is only 8% of the use Retail market, and 70% of walmarts income if from food sales and 90% of walmarts food supply comes from local and national suppliers, like con-agra. When broken down walmart sends a mear penny to china out of ever transaction. something much larger than walmart is helping china out. 

Now these are just 5 of the biggest twisted facts, there are many more out there, both good and bad for walmart, walmart does its share of fact twisting too. However I have seen almost no hard research here on any of the facts being relied on. I have alot of hard proof of lots of these twisted facts but I can not be the only one out looking for the twistes in the facts. And I also am not going to post any of the proofs until others start, because I want everyone here to start doing some research and finding some real reliable facts that we can bring this entry back to a good standing.

Notability of Julien Deschamps
A tag has been placed on Julien Deschamps requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 Enraging Changes and Hyper-Hyphenitis! 

Hello:

I was wondering if you are familiar with the current status of a situation that made/makes me SO MAD MY HEAD IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE ... I mean the situation where the User/Idiot named """"Kwami"""", or something like that, went around willy-nilly changing/moving/redirecting a large number of oncology-related pages by inserting hyphens, giving us combined-small-cell-non-small-cell-carcinoma and other idiotic tripe. What is up with that, sir? Can you elaborate for me at your convenience.

His hyper-anal pseudo-vandalism (sorry) has got me to the point that I just feel like leaving Wikipedia, because just looking at his messes makes me want to puke the whole time I'm on one of the pages.

Any help you can give me, at your convenience of course, would be GREATLY appreciated.

After Arkansas Preservation redesigned their web site a few weeks ago, there are a number of issues with the NRHP part of the site.  I have found at least two instances of listings that are missing from search results, and numerous PDFs of listings are also missing.  If you find what seem to be missing entries, you can try to find them the NRIS mirror run by Elkman, which has all listings up to about April 2010 (i.e. it has no listings or delistings after then).  If they show up in Elkman but not on the Arkansas Preservation site, contact them (info@arkansaspreservation.com), they're pretty good about responding.  On the old web site, I would report errors or omissions that would be fixed within a business day.  Sometimes the omission from their site is caused by an imminent delisting.  For bridges, you can also see if Bridgehunter has images or other information (like better lat/lon, which these two listings need).

In this case, listings for """"Cove Creek Bridge"""" and """"Cove Creek Tributary Bridge"""" both show up in Elkman (Tributary=95000644, Creek=95000645), and are given separate resource identifiers (in the """"Other Names"""" field in Elkman: Tributary=LO0051, Creek=LO0050).  Unfortunately, Logan County appears to be one of the counties whose nomination forms are not currently available on the web site, but they can send copies by email.

Hi David, great explanation and thank you.
I acknowledge and accept your main points above.  My only argument is that the term """"British Isles"""" is being used as a substitute for a more accurate term.  If we substituted the word """"Europe"""", we would lose the point that this was the first anglican bishop to not swear allegiance to the British monarch on behalf of a """"province"""" outside the kindoms controlled by the British monarch (in enemy territory).  The scottish anglicans were still within the area (Kingdom of Great Britain).  As a note, the relevance is those two points taken together - not swearing allegiance *and* not being in an area controlled by the monarch.
BTW, what is the connection between the consecration of Samuel Seabury and the founding of the new province?  Is it assumed that the new province was recognized immediately?  If so, what is the relevance of representative clergy from nine dioceses meeting in Philadelphia to ratify the church's initial constitution in 1789?  Is this the actual official founding of the province?
If you are happy to substitute the term with kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland as a compromise, I am fine with that.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The facts of the marriage have no import because the 1980 judgement which Mr. Marcovitz violated are after the marriage. And Ms. Bruker if you read some of the press has never stated that she was an Orthodox Jewess but Conservative. Again the issue of specific performance is related to ordering someone to do something that may be against his conscience.

c1d21df4b815514d,"aesthetics 
From the 1911 Britanica Encyclopedia:

Greek Speculations
Ancient Greece supolies us with 
the first important contributions to aesthetic theory, 
though these are scarcely, in quality or in quantity, what 
one might nave expected from a people which had so high an 
appreciation of beauty and so strong a bent for philosophic 
speculation.  The first Greek thinker of whose views on the 
subject we really know something is Socrates.  We learn from 
Xenophon's account of him that he regarded the beautiful as 
coincident with the good, and both of them are resolvable 
into the useful.  Every beautiful object is so called because 
it serves came rational end, whether the security or the 
gratification of man.  Socrates appears to have attached 
little importance to the immediate gratification which a 
beauriful object affords to perception and contemplation, 
but to have emphasized rather its power of furthering the 
more necessary ends of life.  The really valuable point in 
his doctrine is the relativity of beauty.  Unlike Plato, 
he recognized no self-beauty (auto to kalon) existing 
absolutely and out of all relation to a percipient mind. 

Plato

Of the views of Plato on the subject, it is hardly less difficult 
to gain a clear conception from the Dialogues, than it is in 
the case of ethical good.  In some of these, various definitions 
of the beautiful are rejected as inadequate by the Platonic 
Socrates.  At the same time we may conclude that Plato's mind 
leaned decidedly to the conception of an absolute beauty, 
which took its place in his scheme of ideas or self-exisiing 
forms.  This true beauty is nothing discoverable as an 
attribute in another thing, for these nre only beautiful things, 
not the beautiful itself.  Love (Eros) produces aspiration 
towards this pure idea.  Elsewhere the soul's intuition of the 
self-beautiful is said to be a reminiscence of its prenatal 
existence.  As to the precise forms in which the idea of beauty 
reveals itself, Plato is not very decided.  His theory of an 
absolute beauty does not easily adjust itself to the notion 
of its contributing merely a variety of sensuous pleasure, 
to which he appears to lean in some dialogues.  He tends 
to identify the self-beautiful with the conceptions of the 
true and the good, and thus there arose the Platonic formula 
kalokagathia. So far as his writings embody the notion of 
any common element in beautiful objects, it is proportion, 
harmony or unity among their parts.  He emphasizes unity in 
its simplest aspect as seen in evenness of line and purity of 
colour.  He recognizes in places the beauty of the mind, and 
seems to think that the highest beauty of proportion is to 
be found in the union of a beautiful mind with a beautiful 
body.  He had but a poor opinion of art, regarding it as a 
trick of imitation (mimesis) which takes us another step 
farther from the luminous sphere of rational intuition into 
the shadowy region of the semblances of sense.  Accordingly, 
in his scheme for an ideal republic, he provided for the most 
inexorable censorship of poets, &c.;, so as to make art as far 
as possible an instrument of moral and political training. 

Aristotle

Aristotle proceeded to a more serious investigation of the 
aesthetic phenomena so as to develop by scientific analysis 
certain principles of beauty and art.  In his treatises on 
poetry and rhetoric he gives us, along with a theory of these 
arts, certain general principles of beauty; and scattered among 
his other writings we find many valuable suggestions on the same 
subject.  He seeks (in the Metaphysics) to distinguish the 
good and the beautiful by saying that the former is always in 
action (`en praxei) whereas the latter may exist in motionless 
things as well (`en akinetois.) At the same time he had 
as a Greek to allow that though essentially different things 
the good might under certain conditions be called beautiful.  
He further distinguished the beautiful from the fit, and in 
a passage of the Politics set beauty above the useful and 
necessary.  He helped to determine another characteristic 
of the beautiful, the absence of all lust or desire in the 
pleasure it bestows.  The universal elements of beauty, 
again, Aristotle finds (in the Metaphysics) to be order 
(taxis), symmetry and definiteness or determinateness (to 
orismenon).  In the Poetics he adds another essential, 
namely, a certain magnitude; it being desir",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Bibliography Revamp with Serialisation 

I'm proposing a revamp of the Bibliography section including the addition of a second table dealing with the serialisations of the Hornblower novels.
The serialisations were actually the first publication of all the works except the first novel so I think they deserve the space.

Currently I've put my proposed new content up at User:Jaa101/sandbox.

With the main bibliography table the main change I'm proposing is to have separate columns for the US and UK titles which are so often different.
This frees up the comments column for other information.
I've also made both the dates of publication and dates of the stories more precise.

One worry I have with both my tables is that I've linked extensively and repeatedly in them.
Normally one would link only on the first occurrence but, in this case, the tables are sortable so what's first may change.
I think it's acceptable as it is.

Finally, I've added mention of the first and most important omnibus """"Captain Hornblower"""" and also the """"Cadet Editions"""".

I propose to change the main page based on feedback.

I am aware of wikipedia policy and don't need to reread it. I broke policy knowingly. I apologize for doing so. It was for the sake of whimsy. That impulse has left me, and I make the promise that it will not return. I do not retract anything that I said. The bigger issue which I have been addressing is the flaw within the system itself. After repeated requests to actually read what I'm saying here and what I actually said on the Beat Generation page, you clearly have mistunderstood me. Your claim that you have ignored evidence in the prosecution of my punishment is one among many disturbing signs of the flaws within the Wikipedia system. What you call extraneous issues are indeed central issues. You have done little to convince me otherwise. For example, the sockpuppetry was a bad idea when considering rules of civility, and I won't let it happen again. It was a good idea in that it was funny, but like I said, that's out of my system. The bigger issue  a central issue, not extraneous  is that admins claimed I was being dishonest. This is evidence of laziness and lack of real concern for the real job you are meant to do. If the real problem is that I was uncivil, then I apologize and make an honest promise that I will never do it again. I don't believe that really is a central issue. I'm not blaming anyone else for me being uncivil; I chose to do it and have never claimed otherwise. The problem is Wikipedia is a toilet. Why is it a toilet? Wikipedia is a punchline. Why is it a punchline? Because people who passionately care about truth get angry (even if it was pretend) on occassion? No. I realize uncivil behavior can be a contributing factor in that it can fail to lead to a positive change; I was practically begging for a positive change on the Beat Generation page, and nothing was happening. Certain other editors were relying on Wikipedia rules to stymie progress. Block me or don't block me, I don't care (and judging from the history of this process and my history with Tao  I fear you'll scan this for trigger words, see """"I don't care"""" and say, """"If you don't care, why are you wasting my time?"""" totally missing the point of what I'm actually saying)  but please look in the mirror and think about the real problem here. If you skip the first part where I genuinely apologize for the actual infraction and said I would never do it again (just as I genuinely apologized for the infraction last time and said I would never do it again  and I can keep saying this over and over again) and if you once again just look at this part and claim I'm focusing on extraneous issues and incorrectly claim that I'm blaming others  blaming others for my rant? no, please actually see: my rant is my responsibility, and once again I apologize for it  whatever you do, despite my lack of faith in anyone's ability to genuinely take some time and think about these things, please just consider what's right and what's wrong here on a larger level while in the short term focusing on my genuine heart-felt apology.

  Are you fing kidding me? There are 30+ reliable sources listed in the pre-vandalism history of the page. This debate in this talk page has no importance and will not receive justice. I am making my objections public for the sake of posterity alone. If you want to see the sources:

 Go look at the history of the page pre-vandalism.
 Go look at the history of the talk page pre-vandalism.
 Go look at the previous AfD discussion where 30+ sources are extensively discussed and analyzed, and consensus found that they were reliable according to the wikipedia definition of """"reliable"""" which you have not familiarized yourself with. 

This debate has already been done and it's very visible in the history of the page and the previous AfDs; the history which has not been consulted by the current deleters attacking this page. Without an """"admin in my pocket"""" my claims fall on deaf ears; I understand this all too well. If you or your allies were interested in due process, you would examine the history instead of asking that all that labour be repeated. Your kind will always demand that others do all the work even when it has been done in exhaustive detail. When you've read this entire page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Law_of_One then you may speak without embarassing yourself. Anyone who has not read that entire page and understood the poles of the debate speaks from ignorance and exposes themselves as lazy deleters happy to erase hours and hours of work without a care.

- ==Straw Poll==  + :I think I know what you were trying to do, but it's best left unsaid. If any editors are sincerely interested in the article, they will go through the talk page line by line just like I did when I first came. That's a pretty pathetic excuse you just gave me. (talk)   
- The Catholic Church talk page is conducting a straw poll here  to decide on a new version that will drastically eliminate about 50% of the information on the page including the Origin and Mission section and the Cultural Influence section and much of everything else.   
- The new, shorter version is here  and the older, more informative version is here  A support vote will make the page become the shorter version, an oppose vote will reject that proposition.    
- ===Accusations of Canvassing by SandyGeorgia===   
- I attempted to convey the above information to the folks on Wikiproject Catholicism and Wikiproject Christianity so they could understand what was happening there and could see the two versions and come to the page and offer their comments. Karanacs had posted a note on that page already but did not provide any information at all in her post about the two differing versions, offering only a link that provided one version.

=The authority of the user Node_ue in the matter of languages

Mark Williamson also known as Node_ue is a kid of 16 years old. (Born at 1989-08-18, Scottsdale, Arizona, United States [] )

What is the authority and credibility of this kid in the matter of languages? He didn't finished his highschool yet. All other words are useless …

Who is Node? Who is Mark Williamson? Just look at the picture:

Poor little Node having problem with languages! Sic!

I think Mark Williamson known also as """"Node ue"""" is having difficulties  with the words out of his mouth!

Nevertheless the authority of Node_ue is very good presented by himself in [] 

Just take a look the way the Kid Mark looks himself: (Warning! May be in various ways interpreted!) 

Mark is an all-powerful entity made of pure energy. If you know him, you will be blessed and your dreams will come true (or at least they might).

Strengths: All powerful, handsome, smart.

Weaknesses: NONE!!! THE GREAT MARK HAS NO WEAKNESSES! HE IS ALL-POWERFUL!

Special Skills: All-powerfulness, intelligence, &c.;

Weapons: All-powerfulness... sharp teeth... hrm...

All-powerfulness: YES! THE GREAT ENTITY KNOWN AS """"MARK"""" IS ALL-POWERFUL!!! YES!

Link to: []

Of course his ass is so painful….Guess why?!

Node's origin as a faggot (gay)…

[] (where he admits he is a faggot)

""""I've also noticed a few things that are possible hints at his thinking he's homosexual/bisexual but not wanting to admit it to himself:
He lies quite a bit to make himself look more """"masculine"""" (apparently he's the most popular guy in school with the girls, and he has to run quickly if he wants to get away from them), he is always going on about how much more attractive he is than me (according to him, this is because both of his parents are of 100% Jewish ancestry, while I only have 3/8ths [3/4ths of the people on my mother's side]), he goes out of his way to make extremely offensive jokes about homo/bisexuality, he goes out of his way to make it look like he's a homophobe, and at the mention of anything even remotely related to homosexuality he has so much disgust for it that he must show that you could fill a whole encyclopedia with his """"ewws"""" (not really meant seriously, according to him).""""

He may be contacted very easy at: 

MSN: aaaboyz1@hotmail.com
Yahoo Messenger:  node_ue (Yahoo ID)
ICQ: 97325293
AOL: IchiUpsideDown
Email address: node.ue@gmail.com

So you wrote yourself: this article is more than just recognition. I write that it is also about illegal precedent... if not only about it. I myself comprehend the term recognition as a term which explains a process. Wiktionary for the english language for (Wikt:recognition) states as the first definition that it is an act or condition of being recognized, whereas wikt:recognize explains this transitive verb as To match something or someone which one currently perceives to a memory of some previous encounter with the same entity. So if we follow the literate meaning we could conclude that to make an act of recognition or come to the state of recognition one should match sth... ...with the same entity. What should should be matched here: eventual Kosovo independence with independence of othere countries. If there are some lists, which you mention, then there are lists of independent (or better nondependant) countries and other entities. Since there is a dispute whether Kosovo should be in one list or some other, some major (as in comparative of lat. magnus - en. bigger) thoughts could be given here. If you mention moving (from one list to the other, than you intuitively agree with me that there could be a POV that a process could exist, or not. Moving, by itself, is a dynamic category (Aristotel discussed this issue long ago), so it could be perceived and comprehended as a process. All this is much simpler (at least for me) to comprehend and explain in serbian language, since serbian language has svršeni and nesvršeni vid of a verb which adds to a bit more refined expression of thought, if I may be so language-subjective. Sorry if I offended you somehow, by quoting your words or in any other way, it wasn't my intention. I will conclude in hope that my too elaborate essay (I may call it now so -) ), constructively adds to comming into terms and resolving the current dispute on the article's content and title.

Then you turn off the heating, but your interior is still at higher temperature, measure it again, and there is still a force - yet smaller. Nothing to do with exotic physics, everything to do with experimental error due to unforeseen effect of evaporation, i.e. ablation (though some moisture might play an effect, especially if there are parts other than metal; this is, in my opinion, the most likely explanation - EM radiation cannot cause such effect at these power/force ratios (that part was also removed from the article, though all was sourced). So, if there is no some weird effect (and QED effects, virtual plasma included, boil down to EM radiation reaction, there is no violation of impulse conservation there, so that is excluded too), it should be reaction from some loss of mass - and evaporation is an obvious source. However, they did not check for that. Also, some of experiments were done in atmosphere (at atmospheric pressure, even in chamber?! according to brief paper), so other possibility is interaction with heated air. However, in vacuum, ablation seems to be most likely explanation. Why all this sourced material and all criticism was removed, beats me. 213.198.221.171",0,0,0,0,0,0

Just because a word is used in an opinion piece, blog, article, or letter to the editor does not mean it needs to be cited as an example.  All of the examples are there because of their political point of view.  They are completely subjective and inappropriate to the page.  All of them should be removed.  I'll go over a couple of them.

""""Character assassination is the Karl Rove tactic of choice, eagerly mimicked by his media surrogates, whenever the White House is confronted by a critic who challenges it on matters of war. The Swift Boating is especially vicious if the critic has more battle scars than a president who connived to serve stateside and a vice president who had """"other priorities"""" during Vietnam."""" –Frank Rich in the August 21, 2005 New York Times[3]

This is purely about Karl Rove, and the opinion writers thoughts on Karl Rove's tactics.  It  offers no meaning or insight to swiftboating.

""""Swiftboating Cindy Sheehan""""[6]
""""Swiftboating the Crazies""""[8]
""""Swiftboating again""""[9]
""""Dean is being swiftboated.""""[10]
""""I do think the race offered one good opportunity for out-of-state Dems and Progressives, and that was to calmly write to newspapers and try to talk to receptive radio hosts about the swiftboating of the candidate.""""[11]
""""I’m glad the efforts to swiftboat Paul Hackett have been exposed for what they are.""""[12]

These are all blog entries which may or may not contain the word swiftboating.  They serve no purpose other than to push a political agenda.

Swiftboat ('swift bOt); transitive verb: (1) To accuse a public figure of questionable conduct without the benefit of physical evidence, usually by an entity informally associated with a person or entity benefiting from the accusation. Noun: (2) An unsubstantiated charge made against a public figure or organization, usually made by a proxy entity. See also: Smear, hatchet job, character assassination. (3) An organization dedicated to swiftboating on behalf of a respectable organization. (4) archaic: a type of boat used by the United States Navy to patrol the shores of Vietnam from 1965 to 1970; see also PCF. [14]

What is represented in the animation that gives the straight-above view is that the overall rotation affects the vibration; the dynamics falls in the category of coupled oscillators. 
 True, the pendulum is not free, the Coriolis effect varies during the motion even if the rotational speed of the Earth is constant.

There is a difference of approach between my sandbox article and the english and french wikipedia articles (I intend to integrate the material in my sandbox article into the english wikipedia article.)

I believe that an encyclopedic article that features a mathematical treatment should focus on the derivation. In the material that I have prepared the mathematical treatment starts with first principles, and subsequently works its way towards the equation of motion:

Once the equation of motion is formulated the physics has been taken care of, and I proceed no further.

I find the treatment in the current english wikipedia article and in the current french wikipedia article unsatisfactory in the following way: the mathematical treatment merely states the equation of motion; the physics taking place (coupling of oscillations) is not discussed.  | Talk",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Someone keeps erasing this with no comment to me...very unethical.   

( minutes after posting this it was erased) check it out. this is very suspicious and unethical by the parties involved. senior management (if in existence) asked to investigate)

````Please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article.
Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts. Additionally, the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the President of the United stat",0,0,0,0,0,0

-    
- After all, Senator Kerry just insured that conservatives will maintain control of both the House AND Sentate this year with his DESPICABLE comments.   
-    
- My DEEPEST condolences to Kerry apologists and liberal editors at Wikipedia (in other words, AT LEAST 90% of you.)   
-    
- In 2004, the dems and their LIBERAL enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Viet Nam, figuring it gave Kerry an edge. So they made it about VNam and thanks to our BRAVE HONEST HEROIC Swift Boat Vets for Truth, it was! LOL! (With additional props to Dan Rather.)   
-    
- In 2006, the dems and their liberal enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Iraq figuring it gave Dems an edge.   
-    
- And thanks to Senator John Kerry, the Dan Rather of 2006, this year's election is about Iraq.    
-    
- Except not quite the way they intended. LOL!!!   
-    
-    
-    
- And no, saying it was 'joke' just won't cut it.    
-    
- This latest Kerry outrage totally fits the LONGSTANDING pattern of Dems hating and denigrating our troops. From Kerry's GI Joe outfit testimony before Congress in 1971 to Dennis Kucinich, to Howard Dean to a San Francisco (where Nancy Pelosi is from) supervisor saying we should SHUT DOWN our military, the antipathy is indelible.   
-    
- And saying, 'Hey! I wasn't trying to insult our troops, just our Commander in Chief!'   
- only makes it worse. The American Legion certainly isn't buying it.

Hello!  informed me that you were asking some questions about why the article you wrote, Offley Place, was speedy deleted. As I am the administrator who deleted it, I'll give you some brief rationale according to Wikipedia conventions and policies. I'm glad you have decided to contribute to Wikipedia, and I hope you continue to add to the project in the future. However, the article Offley Place as you wrote it met the criterion for deletion for two reasons:

The article did not indicate why the subject met the criteria for inclusion that apply to businesses and organizations.
It did not contain any verifiable, third-party references.
It was written in a promotional, rather than an encyclopedic tone. 
It appeared that the only contributor to the article (you) had a significant conflict of interest with the article subject. That is, it appears that your reason for adding the article to Wikipedia is to promote your business, rather than to improve the encyclopedic content of Wikipedia.

Though your first article did not meet the standards for inclusion in an encyclopedia, we hope that you will continue as an editor here. For more information about Wikipedia policies and guidelines, I suggest you take a look at the five pillars of Wikipedia. If you have any more questions, please feel free to let me know on my talk page.

8841f41306f43817,"- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

Seems like you got confused with pro-Hindustani editors. Here is 65 year old statement: 

Article 351. Directive for development of the Hindi language- It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.
http://rajbhasha.nic.in/UI/pagecontent.aspx?pc=MzU=

Hindi emerged as Apabhramsha, a degenerated form, in the 7th century A.D. By the 10th century A.D., it became stable. 'Braj, Awadhi, Khari Boli etc are the dialects of Hindi'. The present literary standard of Hindi is based on 'Khari Boli'. Hindi became the official language of India after 1947
http://hindinideshalaya.nic.in/english/hindi_orgin/briefhistory.html

Where are other languages of India ? What about Braj bhasha, Khadi Boli, Awadhi, Chattisgariya  ? They can call Hindi as much as Urdu speaking people are calling Hindi as Hindustani. The Hindi I speak has more Punjabi & English words than Urdu. The list goes on.

This is my last reply if you continue to present yourself in this manner.  Please write more civilly.

I expect people to go to Oyster Bay just as I expect them to go to Barre, Vermont.  When you type that, do you expect a disambiguation page or do you except the city?  Admittedly, it's not the most convenient, but that's the way it is in all eight """"town"""" states.  Are you going to try to change every single community with this sort of disambiguation?  If so, go ahead — but unless you so desire, don't try to have one or two changed.  You speak of errors that result (for example, the Oyster Bay disambiguation page) — I do my best to fix wrong links as a result of changes such as this, but I don't see why I must be held responsible for every single wrong link.  If you never make mistakes, that's good; but I suspect that you so do.  So what?  It doesn't matter if you make a good-faith error, especially if you try to fix it once you realise that something's wrong.

By the way, if you put """"Oyster Bay, New York"""" into the Census Bureau's Factfinder, you'll get this page: it's the town.  Barre, Vermont is similar to what we'd call a disambiguation page; the city is listed as Barre city, Vermont.  This, I expect, is the reason that these articles are named this way: the Census is our source for the names and the basic information, and therefore we entitle our articles likewise by this reliable source.

9040fd3ef37948db,"This article confuses several different types of anti-personnel ammunition - originally called 'shrapnel' (after its inventor), 'grape' and 'cannister'.  Shrapnel and cannister seem to have been mainly land service ammunition while 'grape' seems to have been mainly naval.

Shrapnel was invented circa 1800, but later that century it was used with more modern shaped shells.  A shrapnel shell is like a flying shotgun, the bullets are ejected while the shell is in flight by a small charge and they fly forwards in a cone.  The charge is initiated by a time fuze (igniferious at this period)in the shell's nose, which is blown clear as the bullets leave.  Bullet sizes varied, but by WW1 they were usually lead antimony alloy with a few hundred bullets per pound weight.

Cannister, in contrast, is bullets in a can and the can bursts as it is fired.  This means cannister is short range.  While shrapnel was little used in WW2, cannister was developed for various weapons including tanks.  Australian Centurion tanks in Vietnam had 20-pdr cannister.

Cannister was always carried by British artillery in its 19th century campaigns and quite widely used. Sometimes it had to be locally assembled from old bully-beef cans. Shrapnel remained their primary anti personnel weapon into WW1, and always the ammunition of choice against 'troops in the open'. In 1945 they successfully trialled 95mm shrapnel fuzed VT.

Beehive, correctly called Splintex, was developed by the US in the Vietnam period.  It is a shrapnel type shell - it is fitted with a mechanical time fuze and the flechettes are fired forward from the shell in flight. It was available for 105mm arty, 106mm RCL, 90mm RCL, and probably others.  US policy was for splintex to be only fired at direct fire, ie for arty it was local defence only, presumably for fear of blinds being re-cycled by the enemy into IEDs.  However, the USSR appears to have subsequently developed 122mm and 152mm shells of this type and used them for indirect fire.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Woolworths Foundation Board of Trustees,

As you requested, here are the faculty recommendations regarding the qualifications of the Umbridge Twins (Mike and SB_Dolores) to assume the duties of Headmaster here at Woolworths School of Political Dramaturgy.

We were especially impressed by the recent production in which the impressionable young students of Woolworths School of Political Dramaturgy were inducted into the long-forgotten practice of employing Parliamentary Bill of Attainder.  The symbolic allusions to the Trial Scene from Alice in Wonderland was an especially brilliant maneuver.

We are confident that, with the Umbridge Twins in charge, our students will quickly learn all the well-known hoary practices from the rubbish heap of political history dating back to the Forgotten Realms of Hammurabi.

And, at the end of the term, all the students are cordially invited to Go Jump In the Lake.

 Whoops. Nice job, kiddo. 

You said, one some poor guy's talk page:

I hope you will use this block time to consider a few matters that could make you a better editor, should you decide to continue. First, Wikipedia editors aren't nearly as stupid as you think they are. We include many people with advanced degrees who work in scholarly professions. Many of us can see through the kind of lies that you tried to use better than we can see through glass. Secondly, disruptive editing, lying, and attempts to sabotage the system not only get you into trouble, they also defeat the very goals that you are trying to achieve. If MattyBraps is deleted, one of the major reasons (but certainly not the only reason) is your behavior as creator of the article. You did serious damage to your own efforts to keep the article on Wikipedia. And finally, take some time to read Wikipedia policies. Start with WP:5P, and every time you see a blue link, click it and read what you see. If you can do these things, you might stand a chance of becoming a good editor. Otherwise, you need to move on to somewhere else to spend your time. Think about it.   

I would contend that Wikipedia editors are, in fact, as stupid as I suspect, as you still fail to grasp that the BT guy and I (the IP user you believe he sockpuppeted) are not the same person. All it took was me mirroring the way he types, pretending to be angry, and claiming """"I made the [Mattybraps] page,"""" and boom, I got him blocked. Thanks for helping me settle a bet about whether or not I could get the creator of the Mattyb wikipedia page (it's an embarrassment that it exists) banned inside of a week. I too have an advanced degree  turns out nobody gives a shit, champ. Keep up the excellent work. 75.64.190.21

 Proposal: Move to """"LGBT community"""" (Part 2) 

Requested move

Gay community → LGBT community — I think the name of this article should be """"LGBT community"""" instead of """"gay community"""". The word gay is an ambiguous and often pejorative term and it doesn't cover anything beside male and female homosexuals. Are bisexuals and trans people gay? According to this name, they are.

We already have LGBT portal, LGBT-related lists, LGBT culture, LGBT people, LGTB history and even LGBT stubs. Do I see somewhere Gay portal, Gay-related lists, Gay culture, Gay people, Gay history and Gay stubs? 

I hereby propose that the article should be renamed to """"LGBT community"""" in order to standardize Wikipedia's coverage on LGBT topics.    

Survey
Feel free to state your position on the renaming proposal by beginning a new line in this section with *'''Support''' or *'''Oppose''', then sign your comment with ~~~~.

One of the members is interested in writing about gay literature, and there has been somewhat of a discussion about whether it should be gay literature or LGBT literature. I believe this was the first discussion of the project. Two of us think that LGBT literature would be best.

 comment 

Hi, It is making it more difficult for researchers by adding """"Sri"""" to Sri Klemp's name. Everytime a search is done for Harold Klemp, Wiki has to keep performing a redirect. I was told that Wiki prefers the directs instead of redirects.  

If you notice, Harold Klemp himself does not publish his books as """"Sri Harold Klemp."""" This title of respect should be put in his bio because it makes it more difficult to find him when doing research. It is going to mess up the categories, etc.  

Instead, the title should be added to the bio or somehow fixed to make it easier for researchers. I don't know how to fix it. So I will put a request on my talk page for help. 

Thank you for contributing to Wikipedia. KarateLady """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Wrong Focus 

I'm new here, but it seems to me that this page, as it now reads, IS about IHD/CAD, to the exclusion of the remainder of cardiovascular disease.  While it may be true that the term """"is usually used to refer to those [diseases] related to atherosclerosis (arterial disease),"""" I would suggest that this is careless usage, to which this page need not subscribe. So how should the article be structured? I'd say look to the table of contents of a textbook of CV disease for a model, with the change that I would pull out all atherosclerotic vascular disease into its own section, with links in the relevant anatomic regions.  Other headings might include Congenital Heart Disease, Valvular Heart Disease, Cardiomyopathies, Dysrhythmias and Conduction Abnormalities, Diseases of the Coronary Arteries, Diseases of the Pericardium, Diseases of the Aorta and Great vessels, Brachiocephalic and Cerebrovascular Disease, Other Peripheral Vascular Disease, Arteritides, Systemic Hypertension, Thrombosis and Embolic Disease, Other Venous System Disease, Diseases of the Pulmonary Vasculature, and Heart Failure and Transplantation. Some discussion of cardiovascular anatomy, physiology,diagnosis, and therapy would also be germane. Although each of these would basically be a definition with a link to its own page, I think the result would be to give the reader a better picture of the vast scope of cardiovascular disease.

bac5d7a187cd528a,"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

The original photo is the one with the """"fall-off"""" effect which was printed in The West Australian already back in august 2, 1969 (~6 min in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMuTiziCszU) while the lighten up picture is the EDITED version who came out much later.

 No, that newspaper doesn't show what the original one looks like.  The original is a transparency that is in NASA's vaults.  They made prints that were widely reprinted. See this for more information.  You talkin' to me? 

Bullshit! excuses from NASA wont make it true! you have the history of that picture in the video i linked to and even the NASA site you linked to shows the fact that the darker picture is the first one, the original from 1969, while the more lighten edited version came out 1975.

 Not to do more drama, but to understand 

Hi Shimeru,

I must say I've been thoroughly surprised of your block on me. I admit freely that my comments were quite over the top, but despite your rationale I've seen no previous warning (nor has the unblocking admin), while instead you took care of warning TreasuryTag for example. Also, I see much worse violations of WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA everyday that even when protested at AN/I or WQA for admin attention do not lead to blocks. I also explicitly stated that no personal attack was meant at all and that mine was (harsh, agree) criticism of opinions.

What done is done; however I would like to understand the rationale for such a tough action against me. I feel strongly I didn't deserve it; however I'm ready to hear your reasoning and in case I'd like to learn from my mistakes. Thank you. talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You appear to have posted this in the wrong location. I did not request a block removal. In fact, I had requested my user page and talk page be *removed*. Because there was an IP block, my guess is that it snagged someone or someones else.

In North America it is considered rude to suggest an action that you know someone cannot take. In this case, knowing that I was blocked, you knew that I could not """"let us know"""" anything, whoever """"us"""" is (is there someone in there with you?). Except insofar as you have office or authority in Wikipedia, no one cares about your personal assessments. In fulfilling your office or in exercising your authority, sharing your personal assessments is inappropriate.

In the United States in particular derogatory references to age, national origin, race, and religion violate both Federal and various state laws, are subject to civil action, and in some cases criminal action, and were I you I whould refrain from making them. You do not know me, my age or sex, and gross impertinence suggesting that I act some age or other is unwarranted. It was, in fact, a personal attack:

If you wish to present as an impartial moderating influence in Wikipedia, leading by example in exercising office or authority, instead of presenting as an ill-bred boorish self-absorbed git, take these few observations in the spirit they were intended, control your editorializing, and familiarize yourself with internationally appropriate demeanor and etiquette.

Narayana Guru and Atheism

I disagree with the text in this section. Associating Narayana Guru with atheism clearly shows the lack of knowledge of the originating author on the Guru's philosophical and metaphysical works and perspective and reasoning of the Universe. Proclaimed atheists being associated with an individual in social reform initiatives does not by itself make the individual an atheist.

Also there is a clear distinction between rationalists and atheists.

This section needs to be edited.

Narayana Guru and Sahodran Ayyappan

Narayana Guru had disagreed with Sahodaran Ayyappan when the latter tried to corrupt Guru's teachings with Atheism.In fact Ayyappan requested Guru's permission to modify the slogan  'Oru Jati , Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu' as 'Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda'. However, Guru ridiculed him by asking """" If Ayyappan wants to collect Rs.1 from each person to set up a library,  you will ask ' Give One Rupee,Give One Rupee,Give One Rupee'. Does that mean ' No Rupee,No Rupee,No Rupee """" ?

This 'Sahodaran' kept quiet at that time.However, he renewed his Atheist activities after the samadhi of Guru, thereby corrupting Guru's ideology. Vested interests fully exploited this confusion to corrupt Guru's teachings by projecting this 'Sahodaran' even above Guru.

Clarification on Atheism

No where in the article did I say that Naryanaguru was an atheist. What I wrote was “his attitude towards the existence of a personal god is considered quite ambivalent” and that many of his followers had considered him an atheist.  Can somebody point out which sentence of the article gives such an impression that he was an atheist?  It goes to the credit of Sri Narayanaguru that in spite of being a theist, he openly accepted even atheists as his core desciples. The importance of this can be guaged only if one consideres the period in which he lived.

One also has to be clear about the kind of thiesm Narayana Guru adovocated. It definitely was not the one associated with the brahaminical/casteist Hiduism.

I find it bit difficult to comprehend why this section on atheism and atheist followers of Narayanaguru should be edited out.  A discussion/debate on the philosophy of Narayanaguru is thoroughly understandable but I find it puzzling that the followers of Narayanaguru are getting overly agitated on hearing the word atheism. Pity indeed! 

And I agree with Aaroamal that there is a distintion between rationalist and atheist. That is precisely why I assert in my user page of wikipedia that I am both an atheist and rationalist.

 Clarification on Atheism 

Manoj, True, you did not explicitly write that Narayana Guru was an atheist. However, you implicitly structured a (misinformed and incomplete) statement as follows:

 “When Sahodaran Ayyappan modified Narayana Guru's famous catchphrase, Oru Jati, Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu (One Caste, One Religion, One God for Humanbeing) and re-written it as Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda Manushyanu…the latter did not protest”. 

Obviously by stating that “…the latter did not protest”, here you are clearly implying that Narayana Guru accepted Sahodaran Ayyappan’s atheistic view as amendment to the famous catchphrase. I am sorry to say that this is absolutely false!

Everybody appreciates that Narayana Guru was tolerant of atheists because he respected an individual’s fundamental right and freedom to belief, or disbelief, in the exitence of God. That tolerant attitude however should not be misinterpreted to imply otherwise.

As Krishnan has already pointed out, Narayana Guru’s reaction to Sahodaran Ayyappan’s revised version of the slogan was a clear protest, so it is not true to say …”the latter did not protest”.

Please could you explain what you mean by saying, “his attitude towards the existence of a personal god is considered quite ambivalent”; are you referring to any of Narayana Guru’s writings, if so which one? Which serious scholar of Narayana Guru has so commented? Also, in what context is that statement being included under the heading “Narayana Guru and Atheism”.

7. Annapolis, MD
8. Trenton, NJ
9. New York, NY
10. Philadelphia
11. Washington, D.C.

I think these are all the places that have any claim of being a capital of the United States.  Of these, New York City and Philadelphia have the strongest claims of being the first capital.  One question to answer is what constitutes being the first capital.  Do we start the clock at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Article of Confederation, or the Constitution.  I think that the Constitution would be the key event because before that, America was really a group of independent colonies rather than a nation.

Also, I believe that New York City did not have the physical infrastructure (buildings, etc.) in place to be an actual capital for the newly formed government.  I think it acted more as a temporary meeting place.  Philadelphia did have a lot of infrastructure for the federal government because it was trying to woe the government into making Philly the permanent capital.

In my opinion, Philly should be considered the first capital of the U.S. because it had actual capital buildings that were used by the government after the signing of the Constitution.  The fact that Philly was also used as the first capital of the colonies is not relevent in my opinion.

However, I am not a historian or an expert in early American history, so I don't want to update the article myself.  Also, from my research, there seems to be a lot of contention about which city is the first capital.  Would a historian or professor of history please comment on this issue and update the page.

 Reply to """"On gender"""" 

Your posted: Don't guess at someone's gender, as you have done here.  It is uncivil, and could in fact be taken as insult.  Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc.  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— dαlus Contribs

Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010."""" Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to """"he’;"""" or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the """"he"""" is actually a """"she"""" and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the """"he"""" is too ballsy or pushy to be a woman/“lady.” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she.” Don't be an ass.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion.

Are you being facetious? if not, you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres. If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide. You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.

The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same """"tag team"""" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.

It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under """"UK mediation"""" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS. Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you.

Criticism is a fine heading, I will gladly rename it or move it to another section if this helps you sleep at night. You are so being biased and then accusing me of it.
Whatever you think is a conclusion is based entirely from your opinion, I did not write those things even in the first version last week which had you guys censor me.
What happened to free wikipedia? Your willingness to censor information is disgusting and you guys are killing the idea of wikipedia being neutral with your bias while claiming you are neutral.

Bray suspects that it may have been the money Bacon gave them that brought the matter to notice: certainly, homosexual relations between masters and servants were clearly common enough to provoke the satirists. As for the weight allotted to it in the article: this is a classic situation in Wikipedia. Any implication of homosexuality in an historical figure has to be detailed and fully referenced beyond normal expectation, otherwise it is then accused of being an unsupported allegation, with the resulting endless edit war. In addition, the earlier point made on this thread about including it: """"Because a significant amount of modern scholarship is focused on how it affected the development of his ontology"""" is extremely valid. The growth of gay studies departments within universities in recent years, and the flood of research and interpretation, is having a significant impact, and is literally re-writing history. To give a tiny example: the discoveries and interpretations in Crompton's 'Byron and Greek Love' have affected every Byron biography published after 1985. Multiply this a thousand times, and one gets an idea of the tsunami of change. For the homophobic this presents a confronting situation, but it's the reality.

 OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page 
Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon.  Pename

What's ironic is that OneGuy claims he is not a muslim and therefore can not be considered an Islamic apologist!  In fact, most of the Muhammad/Islam apologists here claim to not be Muslim!  Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels.  

As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy.  Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal.  OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).

Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.  Feel free to post your complaints regarding OneGuy on Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34/Evidence.    06:56, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Since when replying on talk page has become vandalism? Only one time I deleted Pename comments when he cut and pasted his comments that were already on the page on top of my response in a new section that I created (""""death to critics""""). Pename has ignored what we are discussing and is resorting to personal insults and false accusations (in violation of wiki policy) that I vandalized the talk page. He now claims that he did not copy the verse from anti-Islamic site. If true, where did he find the interpretation that 8:67 means kill prisoners of war? He implied that interpretation in the article. At worst, the verse condemns the behavior of taking prisoners in order to make money, but he has not given his source that says 8:67 means kill prisoners. Instead of answering where he found that interpretation (if not anti-Islamic site), Pename is resorting to personal insults and outright lies that I vandalized the talk page  18:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 You know, I'd be in favour of a reduced Studio Alliances section (""""Studio Support""""), given this isn't a comparison article and as written the whole thing is utterly unreadable. Something along the lines of a bulleted list of studios supporting HD DVD (with an appropriate asterisk and comment next to WB), and a short paragraph reporting that many studios have decided to actively not support HD DVD, preferring Blu-ray, and reporting the major ones. The way I see it, it would work something along the lines of:

Studio Support

To date, approximately 30% of recently released movies are available in HD DVD format. The following studios and publishers offer HD DVD content:

Universal Studios (including subsidiaries Focus Features and Rogue Pictures)
Paramount Pictures
Nickelodeon Movies
MTV Films
DreamWorks Pictures and DreamWorks Animation
The Weinstein Company (including Dimension Films).
The BBC
First Look Studios
Image Entertainment (including the Discovery Channel)
Magnolia Pictures
Brentwood Home Video
Ryko
Koch/Goldhil Entertainment
Medusa Home Entertainment
Studio Canal
Universum Films
Kinowelt Home Entertainment
DVD International
Opus Arte
MK2
Momentum Pictures
Twister Home Video

Additionally Warner Brothers currently releases its content on HD DVD, though has announced it will cease supporting HD DVD in June 2008.

Many major studios have chosen not to support HD DVD, having decided to exclusively back the rival Blu-ray format. These studios include Fox, Disney, and many others.
This is a much simpler and easier to read than the current """"ACME studios announced it plans to support HD DVD for three weeks in March, but pr0n Studios Inc has released 72% of its content in the Chinese EVD format but plans to switch to HD DVD in 2009"""" format that the section is in currently. And it does do away with the need to have a graph in that section as it's no longer a richard-waving area.

WRT """"innocent""""  this is not a """"verified fact"""".  
 Does the Chinese government agree they are """"innocent""""?  No.
 The DoJ appealed Urbina's ruling on Razakah's habeas.  Did they think he is """"innocent""""?
 Urbina wasn't ruling on Razakah's """"innocence"""".  None of the habeas rulings were on whether the captives were """"innocent"""" of a crime.  None of the Uyghurs were charged with a crime.  All of the habeas rulings were on whether the """"preponderance of the evidence"""" supported the Executive Branch claim that it was justified to hold them because the were enemies of the USA, or had supported al Qaeda.

The first Uyghur to get a ruling was Huzaifa Parhat.  His 2008-06-20 ruling was in the only DTA appeal to run to conclusion.  The Executive Branch considered appealing that ruling.  The Executive Branch had a schedule of when it had to file factual returns in the Uyghurs' habeas cases.  The Uyghur's factual returns were due in October.  In those factual returns they would have been obliged to lay out valid evidence to justify the Uyghur's detention.  It is important to quote our sources accurately.  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were """"innocent"""".  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were not, after all, """"enemy combatants"""".  The DoJ simply said that they were changing their plans, and would not put forward arguments that the Uyghurs were """"enemy combatants"""".  Some commentators went on record as interpreting this change of plans not as an acknowledgment that the Uyghurs weren't enemies, but merely as a strategic decision that the value of establishing that the Uyghurs were enemy combatants was insufficient to justify making classified sources public.

Personally, I agree, that the Uyghurs were wrongfully imprisoned.  But I understand that personal opinions like that don't belong in article space.  The wikipedia is not supposed to be used for advocacy.  We shouldn't rewrite history to improperly imply the Uyghur's """"innocence"""" has been an established fact.
As I have explained to you before, if you find Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina.
If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine quotes Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina.
If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine, in summarizing Urbina's ruling, uses that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  attributed to the WP:RS, not to Urbina.
If you find Urbina's ruling, and he used a different phrase, like, """"...the USA has no legal justification to hold Razakah..."""", you are stuck using that phrase, even if other judges used the phrase """"wrongfully imprisoned"""" in other habeas rulings.

WRT where to find the DoJ's appeal...  A reference to the CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard was offered right in the paragraph where I added that the ruling in his habeas was appealed.  The CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard has a column for whether a habeas ruling was appealed.  That column in Razakah's entry says his ruling was appealed.  I urge you to double check references more carefully before claiming assertions were unreferenced.

WRT his """"innocence"""", you assert above: """"There is hardly anybody now who doubt this...""""  this is an argument based on common knowledge.  Further, your draft asserted that their innocence was established """"early"""".  We don't base our articles on common knowledge, or our personal opinions as to what is common knowledge, we base them on what we can verify from authoritative reliable sources.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think that that would be the only way to present a truly fair and neutral portrayal of Max Muller. One other consideration for yourself would be what is you consider a mainstream opinion, because I am sure that you are aware of the politics that goes into getting a paper published and the biases that can play for or against it. Finally, your vehement refutation of other sources based on """"who is he?"""" shows your own inability to question and research into ideas contradictory to others. I would recommend that if you are going to portay a neutral article, please do so by giving both sides of the story.

You know, if you're not even going to give somebody 30 seconds to go in and add the appropriate citations or references, the argument COULD be made that you're just an insecure anal orifice who doesn't want anybody else adding to what he perceives as """"his"""" page - that TOTALLY flies in the very face of what Wikipedia is supposed to be about.  I WAS going to add the appropriate references, including a link to a WAV of the song, but since I don't feel like wasting my time, only to have your ego play Goebbels again, why bother.  By the way, I'm not sure how you arrive at your conclusion that it's somehow """"libelous"""", to point out that a celebrity (who, by the way, has been deceased for 35 years) actually had a sense of humor about his own foibles, but it's asinine!

Deletion of Robert A Foster
Hello you have deleted a page for Robert A Foster. Please could you put it back on or can I make a new one? He is in the New BBC 'Just William' and is a up and coming actor.Many Thanks 9:00,29 Nov 2010 (GMT)
Hi. The entire contents of the page you (I assume) created and I deleted was {{hang on}}. The prior contents of the page, deleted by a different administrator, was [[Just William (2010 TV serial)]]. So the page was basically a blank slate with no tailored text at all upon both creations. If this actor is notable (see also Wikipedia:Notability (people)#Entertainers) then I suggest you create the page as a subpage of your user or user talk page so that you have time to work on it before """"going live"""" by placing it in the main part of the encyclopedia, and so it doesn't get deleted again as having no substantive content. There is an article wizard which can walk you through the steps. You say he is an """"up and coming actor"""". Well I don't know if there are sufficient sources to support an encyclopedia article, but this statement makes me wary. Please see Wikipedia:Up and coming next big thing. Note that if the page is an appropriate topic for an article, it would take normal English name punctuation, which means the middle initial would take a period, i.e., Robert A. Foster.  

Deletion of International Association of Physics Students
Hello! You deleted the article for the International Association of Physics Students based on copyright infringement from the webpage iaps.info. It did seem that way, as the article was mostly copied from iaps.info, but it was done by the Executive Committee of IAPS, so we would like to ask you to reinstate the article. If it is needed we can put a statement on the homepage allowing wikipedia to copy written content from our page or something like that. Thanks!—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
Hi P.O.E. I have taken the liberty of adding a section header to your post and adding your signature; on talk pages (but not in articles), you should sign your posts so that people can follow who wrote what.Regarding the above page, there's a few matters you should understand. We cannot use copyrighted text simply because we have been given permission. Instead all of our text must be freely licensed so that our end users can take the material and use it themselves under our licenses. Please see Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials. The upshot is that for us to use the material—which means allowing our readers to use it and modify it even for commercial purposes—we have to have a verified release of the material. To do that, you can follow either of the methods listed at the page. Specifically, please look at the subsection of the page entitled Granting us permission to copy material already online.If you do that, it will take care of a first hurdle but I don't think you should bother because the text itself is not appropriate for an article it its current form. This is an encyclopedia. Can you imagine a proper encyclopedia articles saying things like """"We support our members...""""? What you should do is start from scratch and try to write a proper encyclopedia article that cites to reliable third party sources and contains neutral language. ([[User tal",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Walking in on the middle of an argument 

Thanks for the message, however the analogy you've chosen is incorrect, when I walk in on an argument then I cannot have heard what has happened before, however on a talk page I can read the whole thing and trace any talk page discussion. When I posted my first question was intentionally dumbed down, as if I didn't know what was going on, then as the replies came in I could respond to them. In terms of NPOV in articles this is how I see it; for example, person A writes and article which contains the phrase """"Scientology is bad"""", there is then an article written about Person A, Mr A was born in..., and on..., and live with..., et cetera. Then under his work it says """"He wrote an article saying 'Scientology is Bad'"""". I could not in all conscience remove that statement from the article, because the bias is from the speaker not the editor. The gist of the talk page on WP:SCN was that any negative comments which had been quoted accurately but were negative should be """"balanced"""" out. And that is not something I could let happen.

content moved from bennelong medal talk page
I feel this page is notable as it is not included on the Bennelong Society entry, where it should rightly go. I attempted to put it there and it was repeatedly deleted and I did not want to enter an edit war. Therefore it exists as a separate page.

 There appear to be some mentions in Google; you should add some to the article.  

I removed the notability warning as  seems to have contradicted himself by adding a notability warning prior to checking basic searches such as google. I'll add some links and expand the article so it can be merged back into Bennelong Society when time permits (unless  would like to make some constructive edits? ) ).  

 Article did not cite any third party sources when I added the tag; the onus is not on other editors to cite sources for material.  

 What on thi spage needs cleaning up? It states the data and the source. What else could there be. The article did site one third party source at the time of you first tagging, it was within the body of the article, as it was a hyperlink, as opposed to at the end. This surely suggests that you have not actually read the article fully. The added sources to keep you happy are in fact irrelevant as they add nothing to the article and in adding to the length of the article, remove some of its encyclopædic nature.

 Model S Base Price Needs Updating - No longer speculative

 Restructuring 

I tried to restructure this by putting in some sections.  Things I wish were a little better:
 The section on the roadster may be getting a little too big, since there's already a page on it.  But I think the specs on the car go towards explaining the company's business model.
 English vs American usage is a bit of a problem here since we have Lotus, an English company, and Tesla, an American company.  I'm staying with American style as per the original version and since this is about an American car.  I tried to avoid constructions that sound odd on the other continent but I'm not sure I succeeded.

 Tesla Motors Marketing? 

This reads to me as a staged bit of company hype until I see footage of a real vehicle and some third party confirmation of the putative statistics. This whole thing reads like a marketing ploy with Wikipedia furnishing the advertising medium. User:69.7.41.230

Seat-of-the-pants acceleration statistics have been reported on by several independent press reporters; see for instance this LA Times article by Dan Neil (including video) and this Forbes article by Elizabeth Corcoran. YouTube has even more video.  While independent test track information has not yet been published, this is to be expected as common practice for automobile companies during development of a new vehicle. It is unusual, however, for Tesla to allow so many reporters to ride in their 3rd gen evaluation prototypes (development vehicles).  The reported efficiency of 133 Wh/km, while quite good, is very much in line with other electric vehicles.  Similarly, reports of the energy (56kWh) and power (220kW) content of the li-ion pack are well within the range of other li-ion battery packs.  How might we improve the article to sound less like a """"marketing ploy""""?  

I agree that the article reads like an advertisment, the Models section especially, and as asuch I will add an advert warning to the section until the advert feel is gone.   

 That single comment is 3.5 years old and is no longer relevant. The article has gone through multiple revisions by multiple editors since that time.   

These revisions evidently did nothing to solve the adverts, you should know you have been editing this page for over 3.5 years.

Whatever the flight should be called depends on what criteria are used.  If one goes by what the tickets read and what the gate agents and flight attendants announced, the flight is Delta Flight 5191 (or if you want to be real technical, something very similar to """"Delta Flight 5191 operated by Comair for Delta Connection.""""  However, if one goes by how the pilots and air traffic controllers referred to the flight, then it is Comair Flight 191 (their actual words would have been """"Comair 191.""""  Thus far the news media has called it Comair Flight 5191, probably for two reasons:  One, the flight was called 5191 everywhere that wasn't """"behind the scenes"""", and two, Delta wants to make it clear that the flight wasn't operated by Delta, but was instead operated by Comair.

Let us examine what is considered """"Black"""" in the context of this very article. At the very top it states:

""""It is also used to categorize a number of diverse populations together based on historical and prehistorical ancestral relationships. Some definitions of the term include only people of relatively recent Sub Saharan African descent (see African diaspora). Among the members of this group, dark skin is most often accompanied by the expression of natural afro-hair texture (although a recent scientific study notes that human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations). Other definitions of the term """"black people"""" extend to other populations characterized by dark skin, including some indigenous to Oceania and Southeast Asia""""

This article even mentions Oceanians and Southeast Asians (such as the Great Andamanese, Native Fijians, the Ati,  and the Melanesians) even though these groups genetically have more in common with neighboring Asian populations and are very distant from other people who are considered Black Africans. Ethiopians are black Africans. Some of them have Middle-Eastern ancestry (Ethiopia is a short boat ride from Arabia), but that automatically does not make them an entirely mixed population; nor does it change the fact that their roots are mainly in Africa. Sicilians have some Middle-Eastern ancestry, but they are still considered European. Ancient Romans certainly referred to Ethiopians as black. They used the term """"Ethiopian"""" to describe all Black Africans they came across, regardless of their location outside of East Africa (read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_expeditions_to_Sub-Saharan_Africa)

I went to the Beta Israel page and found two very clear references: 

Ephraim Isaac (1974), The Falasha: Black Jews of Ethiopia. Dillard University Scholar Statesman Lecture Series.

Simon D. Messing (1982). The Story of the Falashas """"Black Jews of Ethiopia"""". Brooklyn. ISBN 0-9615946-9-1

Here's more from another article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Israel#Black_Hebrew_Israelite_immigration)

Rebhun, Uzi, Jews in Israel: contemporary social and cultural patterns

""""The Israeli government has airlifted black Ethiopian Jews to Israel and given them citizenship in the same way it has been a haven to Jews oppressed throughout the Middle East and Africa""""

""""She told RT: “They don't want poor or black children and Depo-Provera gave them the opportunity to have control. If she [a patient] keeps taking an injection every three months, she is not going to have children – you know it is a 100 per cent secure from children I think.”

Hedva says the policy is working – the number of black babies in Israel is decreasing, but there are no official statistics to back up her claim. For community workers and Ethiopian women here, statistics are unnecessary – they feel their reality speaks for itself.

The Health Ministry admits it issues the drug, but says it was never its policy only to administer it to Ethiopian women and reduce the number of black babies in the country.""""

I would say that makes Ethiopian Jew's a valid part of this article.

As this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) 

That has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk) 
No, I'm not saying cite both sources. References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia's voice. If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality, then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy - there is no need to cite the study. Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study, we might mention this study in the text, but the study itself is not reference for the statement. And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. If you have concerns about the other sources in the article, you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. Nat Gertler (talk)

Compatibility
Paul Thurott has written an article about compatibility issues with the Beta, which makes me doubt the final release's compatibility.  

Removed Features
 
 
 _/|\_I don't know why the Removed Features section claims that the classic start menu and taskbar will be
 removed. Nor do I know why the Inkball game is supposedly removed. This section cites no references and these
 claims are the most questionable.  

I'm not sure as the the reasons as to why they we're removed but I can tell you that Ink Ball is not found anywhere in the beta release, I'm not sure about the classic start menu and taskbar, i don't see an option for them but I didn't look all that hard   

 Inkball only appears in Tablet Edition windows products.  Is there a tablet addition of the Windows 7 beta?   
 Hmm... I may be wrong there.  The article mentions that it also appeared in Vista Home Edition.  Still, Can't imagine it's very fun with a mouse.   
It does indeed come with Vista Home Premium, not sure about other editions.   
It also comes with Ultimate. But anyway, mentioning it has been removed if the only evidence we have is it's not included in the current beta is an incredibly bad idea. We need a reliable source saying Microsoft has decided to remove it. There could be plenty of reasons why it's not in beta, only one of them is Microsoft has decided to remove it completely

Notability of Julia Olteanu
A tag has been placed on Julia Olteanu requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  Excalibur! 

AfD nomination of Julia Olteanu
An article that you have been involved in editing, Julia Olteanu, has been listed for deletion.  If you are interested in the deletion discussion, please participate by adding your comments at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Julia Olteanu.  Thank you. Excalibur! 

Articles for deletion
Hi!  I noticed that you've been participating in the deletion discussions at WP:AFD.  Thanks; we can always use the help.  Since AfD isn't a vote but a discussion, your recent contributions haven't been as helpful as you might hope; in addition to a 'keep' or 'delete,' some information about why the article under discussion meets or doesn't meet Wikipedia's standards is needed.  You might find this essay to be an interesting source of advice about how to make your AfD contributions most helpful. - (talk · contribs) 
hmm i dont totally agree with you because why have a vote when the vote doesnt count. a vote should count in when a page is either deleted or the opposite.  
It isn't really a matter of agreeing or disagreeing.  Regardless of what you may think it should be, AfD is not a vote, and doesn't function as one; administrators reading the discussion to determine consensus just disregard any comments that don't include reasons that are based in Wikipedia policy.  You are welcome to continue participating in the way you are, but it is not a useful way to spend your time, since your contributions won't be used to determine whether an article should be deleted or not. - (talk · contribs)  —Preceding comment was added at

 Perspective? 
""""In the trial Shylock represents the Jewish side in contrast to the Christian one in a matter of highest importance: Justice (Jewish, Old Testament) is confronted with Mercy (Christian, New Testament). In the Christian view mercy is the decisive step after justice is reached. Therefore the Christians in the courtroom urge mercy. Beside the fact, that Shylock as a Jew is not in duty to give mercy, he is not able as well, because for this you need love. He doesn't find love at all, but hate. Shakespeare explains this in Shylock's monologue very clearly. To be merciful despite the hate nevertheless you have to love your enemy (New Testament). That means in fact that the Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to behave like a very true Christian by loving his enemies although they themselves failed even in loving just their neighbours (the Jews) in the past before.""""

 No offense taken, but I see no need to moderate my tone.  Any venom in it I feel is warranted, and I am not the type to tiptoe around anything for the sake of WP:Civility or whatever random set of rules on a page I'll never read.  I speak here the same way I'd speak in an academic forum, in front of a work committee, or in front of Joe Schmoe on the street. I grant no special lee way to - of ALL people - some people on the internet.  Now moving back to the point, the request to move is not a courtesy to her fans, but for all the reasons I stated.  Nowhere did I mention her fans.  If it is a courtesy to anyone, it is to bell hooks herself, out of respect for her personal statement.  And the issue at hand here is why we SHOULD move it, as that is the proposal, and many reasons have been given.  It is not necessary to prove that she """"does not want her name to be capitalized"""".  

Or are you trying to say that such a finding would supersede all other arguments and be grounds upon which to make the move?  If so, then you are being contrary and absurd.  My burden, and those who support the move, was to provide reasons for the move, and it is then up to the opposition to cite reasons against it, which they have not done.  Some have even changed their vote from oppose to support.  Even , for all of his wordiness, seems to be in support of the move, but is just playing his role as administrator, and being cautious before he commits to the move.  I'd say overly so, but that is my opinion.  Even if the lack of """"proof"""" you're looking for was the only reason against the move, the overwhelming reasons for the move supersede it.

Don't Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called """"Coal Wars"""". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal's Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn't taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal. (not through reverts by me, but by others who agreed with my position.) I have not edited coal since my block, so I'm not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven't gone back to doing.

Also, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her """"Happiness"""" article under the section """"Philsoophy of Happiness."""" Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche's moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: """"Unsourced"""" as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.

Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR."""" I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me """"your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I'm tempted to revert them."""" Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks.

Malfunctioning archive bot and improper archive page creations?

I do not know why there have been three additional archive pages for my talk page created, none of which is full, since yesterday.  I just saw this comment of Sept. 10, 2008, because someone or something placed it in an archive page (25) that did not exist last night or even early this morning.  I almost didn't see it at all.  Everyone who posts in Wikipedia is a real person; we use log-in identities to protect our privacy and our private identities.  If someone uses his or her real name in Wikipedia, it is published in this version of Wikipedia and all over the internet.  I have no control over others' practices in choosing Wikipedia identities, and I am not aware of anything that I have done that violates WP:AGF, WP:CIVIL, Wikipedia:Etiquette in my comments in either of the AN/I situations.  Although I have continually posted my concerns in good faith, I have been continually set upon as if I have not.  I assure you that since first contributing to Wikipedia as """"NYScholar"""" in June 2005, I have done my best to learn about and to follow Wikipedia's obviously-convoluted and often contradictory editing policies and guidelines, which are frequently edited and changed by those editing Wikipedia, and often vandalized.  I have done my best to contribute to Wikipedia in good faith and yet be forced (demanded) to respond to in my own view entirely-unfounded and false charges that I have not been editing in good faith.  Despite my requests for compassion and understanding because I have other important non-Wikipedia work to do (which have been in the """"N.B."""" above and were only edited out in the past two days in response to Shell's comments about the """"N.B."""" section), I was continually being forced by administrators and others to reply to them in what I increasingly regard as a dysfunctional AN/I based on both misunderstandings and violations of the AN/I instructions by the user who posted it and by the continual references to a previous AN/I by others, including administrators, extending it when it should have been expunged.

If posting new comments, please do so in my current talk page and do not create or add new archive pages.  The bot may be misfunctioning again.  Perhaps the code needs to be checked again.  When I revised the """"N.B."""" at Shell's request (above), I moved down the template.  Perhaps some is wrong again in it now.  I am manually going to move the comments mis-archived into the current talk page if that is where they belong, and I will move what should have been archived (if anything) into archive 22, which is not """"full"""" as it states in my """"contributors"""" history.

At the same time, the khan of Sheki too signed a similar treaty, for example. I know Michael Croissant, and his book is full of mistakes and errors, his book doesn't mean much in this regard. His mistakes are too gross  the Russo-Iran war started in 1806, whilst Karabakh became part of Russia in 1805 before such a war. Meanwhile, Tim Potier is a good legal expert, and it is surprizing to see him write that. But everyone is entitled to errors and his was due to lack of resources - he was limited as a scholar in variety of materials and legal status of Karabakh in 19th century was not his objective  the 20th century was. Anyways, I do not know the khans of Iran in the south and which treaties they concluded with British. If they did it in the Zand period, they probably had full legal right at the time, since Iran was more of a geographic entity, than political. Same with Azerbaijan (North) - it was geographic too. Whilst I do not remember the legal documents and letters of the time, the later Russian and British documents clearly identified Azerbaijanis of the North as """"aderbeijani tatars"""" - I have evidence of that as far back as 1880 in British census estimates and in the 1897 official Russian Imperial Census. Same word is used by Russian ethnographer Velichko in his 1903 book. Azerbaijani author, Firudin bey Kocharly wrote a book in 1908 """"Literature of Azerbaijani Turks"""". 

Anyways, Azerbaijanis simultaneously fought against both Iran and Russia at the time, and some sided with either one side or another. Unfortunately, you won't find much on that in libraries - but just one such translated book would allow scholars to reconsider mistaken assumptions. What is more important however, is that Karabakh khan (khan being a Turkic term derived from kagan), was that it concluded its own treaty, that it minted its own money (one of the typical examples of independence), and fought several wars with Iran, some handily winning, others, like 1797, ambgiously  but still Shah Muhammed Qajar gets killed. And I don't know who told you about Vagif and Ibrahim  by the later you probably mean Ibrahim khan, right? Well, Vagif, the poet and vizier, was executed in 1797, AFTER shah's death, and was executed by the temporary ruler, Mamed bey Jevanshir, who was nephew of Ibrahim khan. While details are murky and contradictory, the Qajars didn't have the primary rolse in this  indeed, once shah was killed, Iranian troops withdrew, it screwed up all the plans to re-conquering other parts of Azerbaijan and Georgia. Meanwhile, Ibrahim khan lived and ruled the khanate until tragic error - or so it is explained  in 1806. But anyway, the Kurekchay Treaty was signed by him. Thus, once more, Karabakh khanate, for one, was totally independent, and Iran had no legitimate or otherwise claims whatsoever to it. Meanwhile, few other khanates were nominally dependent - like Poland was to USSR, or Armenia to Russia (Russian speaker of Parliament, #3 person in the country, openly called it """"forepost of Russia"""" whilst in Armenia).

, you are very much on the right track now. A few things you'll want to adjust:
If you have more sources that are also strong, especially ones that talk a little more about her overall career rather than just her books, that would help flesh out the depiction of her.
When you have a list of items, like works or links, make sure to """"bullet"""" each item using a """"*"""", just like I'm doing here. And you needn't leave blank lines between list items when you bullet.
Carefully skim through and remove *anything* that is even slightly subjective praise that's not directly sourced to a review/commentator. That is, if the NYT says she's """"splendiferous"""" you can mention that, mention NYT said it, and cite it. But you absolutely cannot refer to her as """"renowned"""", """"pathbreaking"""", """"stellar"""", """"imaginative"""" etc in Wikipedia's own voice.
This would likely pass just as it is, but there's no harm and much benefit to continuing to beef it up a little. Also, if her birth year is public record (i.e. mentioned on some university site, news article, etc., not by digging in city archives) then please include that next to her name.

In true BWilkins style though, someone else has to take his nonsense blocks to their inevitable conclusion . So take your bow Reaper Eternal, there's a good lad.

So here goes, BWilkins presumably blocked me because he thought I was about to OUT someone, yet in his incompetence failed to lock this page, so.....drum roll......User:Mo ainm used to be User:BigDunc, the account that 'retired' and never went back to editting the same articles, pulling the same stunts, or so the public record would have you believe.

Yes, that's the super secret information that the esteemed *arbitrator* Elen of the Roads thinks should be permanently stricken from the record, even though he's now the very conspicuous last man standing of a clique of Irish Republican editors who have been skewing Wikipedia articles for YEARS using the same despicable tactics, and are only now starting to be noticed by the sloths who work AE and be dealt with as appropriate (or 'retire' as they see the wriitng on the wall for their hard won 'reputations' as editors in 'good standing' who never got noticed by the dumbshits who are supposed to monitor editors for compliance with all policies, not just the easy ones).

Mo survives due in no small part to the fact that none of his mates ever had the good fortune of getting away with a mid-life secret change of identity, as well as the general cowardice of people like BWilkins, who usually run a mile rather than deal with something complex like GAMEing on Irish republican related articles. Nope, that's far too much like work for that lazy prick.

This change of identity is being covered up by Elen on the grounds of OUTing. Yes, that's right, Elen wants to stake her reputation on a patently ridiculous claim that knowing that Mo ainm is really a bloke called Duncan who lives in Ireland, is a violation of WP:OUTING, just to cover up the fact that she never bothered to verify whether this was 100% grade A bullshit before she started blocking people for calling it as such, those who were there at the beginning and know just exactly how this lucky cunt came to have this excuse land in his lap and save him from a complete FAIL in understanding what is and is not a CLEANSTART.

So here we are, with sponge brained morons like Reaper and detestible assholes like BWilkins continuing the farce with blocks and censures like this. So well done guys. Assuming neither of you has the backbone to do the necessary and end this farce once and for all by calling Elen out on her lies, one of you has to now ensure this post gets oversighted so she can continue this OUTing bullshit story of hers to cover her own incompetent deceitful ass.

 Good job 

Excellent work on forming those citations. They really improve the article don't they? If you're up to it, you might try the third point in my comment on the article's talk page about adding the Infobox writer template. (I consider the first two points as already covered now). You don't have to do this as it is an elective but if you should decide that it would be an improvement then I would encourage you to give it a try. Try looking at the author's infobox on the right side in this article as an example.

If you decide that you want the infobox but have trouble implementing it then let me know and I'll help you. I'm also going to leave you a welcome below with a collection of links to help you navigate Wikipedia. You show excellent promise for being an editor here so I would encourage you to edit and write articles for the pleasure of it rather than just those that fall within your professional scope. I believe you might find enjoyment in that as well as being able to share your editing contributions with others. —  (talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'll have to take a closer look at the current version of the article, because I have an uneasy feeling that the answer actually is found in one of the subsidiary articles, such as Lydian mode. The short answer is that the connection between the Greek harmoniai and the medieval modes is more tenuous than you appear to believe, and the connection between medieval and modern modes is fairly straightforward. The """"modern system"""" is actually that of Common Practice Tonality, and """"modal"""" usage within that context begins to establish itself as a separate idea during the 18th century. The chief difference from medieval practice is a more rigid adherence to the diatonic notes of the scale. For example, in the medieval system, there is no practical difference between the Lydian scale and what we call the major scale, or between the Dorian and what we call the minor scale. In order to differentiate """"modal flavor"""" from the chromatic flexibility of the upper half of the minor scale, for example, it became necessary to insist on always using the minor-seventh scale degree, especially in ascent to the tonic, and the sixth degree had to be always major to identify Dorian, and always minor to identify Aeolian. No such practice existed up to the 16th century, and indeed it was only with Glareanus in the mid-16th century that a theoretical difference was made between Dorian and Aeolian on the one hand, and Lydian and Ionian on the other.

fb85c9434fac2777,"This is the lead as it currently reads: Lance Edward Armstrong (born Lance Edward Gunderson, September 18, 1971) is an American former professional road racing cyclist and triathlete. He won the Tour de France seven consecutive times (1999-2005) but was stripped of those titles by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and banned from cycling in 2012.

We have basically two things to consider: whether this is factually correct and whether it provides the proper emphasis. I'd say that the first clause of the second sentence is at the very least misleading since 1) there is now a consensus in the world at large that Armstrong did not properly win the Tour de France ever and since 2), as far as official racing he is concerned, he did not win the Tour de France at all. It would be far more accurate to say that Armstrong was once considered to have won the Tour de France seven times. This state of affairs is very unlikely to change. As for emphasis, at this point Armstrong is more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else. As time passes this is bound to  intensify. Since it is now obvious that Armstrong achieved his original fame by cheating and committing fraud, there is no reason he should not be more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hungary during the Holocaust -The Kastner train 

             The 1955 Kasztner libel case: the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi.
The state of Israel claimed that Malkiel Grünwald's allegations against Kasztner were a lie. When Grünwald published these accusations, the Israeli Government did rather more than demand that his views should not be broadcast. Because a prominent Zionist official (Dr. Kastner was a spokesman for the Ministry of Trade and Industry) was involved, the Attorney General of the State of Israel prosecuted Grünwald for criminal libel. Let the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi (who later became one of the panel of three judges that tried Eichmann) in Israel's District Court of Jerusalem speak for itself.
The Attorney General v. Malkiel Grünwald
This material should be studied carefully. The masses of Jews from Hungary's ghettos obediently boarded the deportation trains without knowing their fate. They were full of confidence in the false information that they were being transferred to Kenyermeze. The Nazis could not have misled the masses of Jews so conclusively had they not spread their false information through Jewish channels. 
The Jews of the ghettos would not have trusted the Nazi or Hungarian rulers. But they had trust in their Jewish leaders. Eichmann and others used this known fact as part of their calculated plan to mislead the Jews. They were able to deport the Jews to their extermination by the help of Jewish leaders. The false information was spread by the Jewish leaders. The local leaders of the Jews of Kluj and Nodvarod knew that other leaders were spreading such false information and did not protest. Those of the Jews who tried to warn their friends of the truth were persecuted by the Jewish leaders in charge of the local 'rescue work'. The trust of the Jews in the misleading information and their lack of knowledge that their wives, children and themselves were about to be deported to the gas chambers of Auschwitz led the victims to remain quiescent in their ghettos. It seduced them into not resisting or hampering the deportation orders. Dozens of thousands of Jews were guarded in their ghettos by a few dozen police. Yet even vigorous young Jews made no attempt to overpower these few guards and escape to nearby Rumania. No resistance activities to the deportations were organized in these ghettos. And the Jewish leaders did everything in their power to soothe the Jews in the ghettos and to prevent such resistance activities. The same Jews who spread in Kluj and Nodvarod the false rumor of Kenyermeze, or confirmed it, the same public leaders who did not warn their own people against the misleading statements, the same Jewish leaders who did not organize any resistance or any sabotage of deportations . . . these same leaders did not join the people of their community in their ride to Auschwitz, but were all included in the Rescue train. The Nazi organizers of extermination and the perpetrators of extermination permitted Rudolf Kastner and the members of the Jewish Council in Budapest to save themselves, their relatives, and friends. The Nazis did this as a means of making the local Jewish leaders, whom they favoured, dependent on the Nazi regime, dependent on its good will during the time of its fatal deportation schedule. In short, the Nazis succeeded in bringing the Jewish leaders into collaboration with the Nazis at the time of the catastrophe.

The Nazi chiefs knew that the Zionists were a most vital element in Jewry and the most trusted by the Jews. The Nazis drew a lesson from the Warsaw ghetto and other belligerent ghettos. They learned that Jews were able to sell their lives very expensively if honorably guided. Eichmann did not want a second Warsaw. For this reason, the Nazis exerted themselves to mislead and bribe the Jewish leaders. The personality of Rudolph Kastner made him a convenient catspaw for Eichmann and his clique, to draw into collaboration and make their task easier.

The question here is not, as stated by the Attorney General in his summation, whether members of the Jewish Rescue Committee were or were not capable of fulfilling their duty without the patronage of the S.S. chiefs. It is obvious that without such S.S. Nazi patronage the Jewish Rescue Committee could not have existed, and could have acted only as an underground. The question is, as put by the lawyer for the defense, why were the Nazis interested in the existence of the Rescue Committee? Why did the S.S. chiefs make every effort to encourage the existence of the Jewish Rescue Committee? Did the exterminators turn into rescuers?

The same question rises concerning the rescue of prominent Jews by these German killers of Jews. Was the rescue of such Jews a part of the extermination plan of the killers ? The support given by the extermination leaders to Kastner's Rescue Committee proves that indeed there",0,0,0,0,0,0

When you have read [{WP:CITE]] and WP:UNDUE, we can discuss this further.  Length is not the issue, focus and balance is.

I think """"most"""" readers are people who like horses and want to know about riding clothing, thus a modern focus is needed.  And we cannot break this impasse because I am pretty sure that no one has taken a poll of what readers of wikipedia want to know about jodhpurs.  There is a place for a history section, but there already is a link to the Maharaja, so a lot of what you proposed probably needs to go there.  But for the ref, links to images are seldom accessed anyway,so footnoting is perfectly proper and in line with wikipedia's manual of style. If the actual images can uploaded to commons, then I think adding one good historical image to the article is useful, but otherwise, they are awkward in the text.  I also have no beef with clarifying that they aren't precisely breeches, as they go to the ankle, except that no one has yet provided a dictionary definition or either term.  One problem is that you and I both noticed that flared-hip breeches worn with tall boots get called """"jodhpurs"""" in popular culture (the aviator/Hollywood/Military look), even thought they are technically breeches.

This article as a whole is subject to a confused identity and I have no idea what to make of it. When I have insane nationalists blaming an entire ethnic group with inherited sin and racially abusing me by declaring me a non-native of where I was fucking born and bought up, then I start to wonder why I should care in the first place. But if anything, the article should focus on the cultural exchange between the English and Welsh, if this makes any sense - how each others culture has influenced the other, i.e. loan words, trade, traditions etc, whatever - anything to do with culture (I live in Devon. Some of our traditions and place-names are of """"West Welsh"""" Celtic origins, most of us probably have Celtic DNA but we are most certainly not Welsh or Celtic! And don't get me started on that """"DEWNANS"""" crap). It shouldn't be some political ethnic relations piece. I have no idea who put that lead sentence in, but they are clearly a smiling Welsh or English person, sitting in a cafe (or an English """"footy"""" pub) right now drinking coffee that has been spat in by someone with an ethnic chip on their shoulder. I've met plenty of nice, decent, honest Welsh people - but the die-hard ethno cultural nationalist ones? I've met Irish Republicans, Scottish nationalists...and I find them more agreeable and less inclined to automatic hatred once they know my stance on things, but when it comes to general views of the English from the Welsh side of the nationalist coin...oh by. It's a 1500-year-old blood feud. As for how the worst of the English view the Welsh - it's usually just stereotype mockery or snobbishness, and it's very effing common.

Jack, You do no service to the reader by peddling inaccurate information, the decision about the jersey was commercial, no organization claimed it as sectarian.

I would also remind him there is an article dedicated to Sectarianism, and further information can be obtained there.

I would also ask Jack why he is asking user Rockpocket to mediate or intervene, perhaps he feels that user will be more likely to agree to his point of view, given his statement(not that I would suggest an Admin would be non-neutral):

Reverting edits is the only course of action open to those of us who feel the section is in error.

Beyond that, I believe all the sections after the big 'ol links section can be eliminated as unnecessary overlap with other articles.  After that's done, we should give the big 'ol table a thorough review and post a suggestion at Talk:Computer for anyone interested to review this article before we move it to main space.  Afterwards, we probably should request this article to be deleted since temporary pages in mainspace is now disallowed per WP:SP.

 United Wrestling Association 

Thank you very much for your time & effort cleaning up United Wrestling Association. It looks wonderful now. I appreciate that very much.  

 Triple Crown and Grand Slam Champions 

I am not and was never looking to start trouble, all I am trying to do is expand a definition based on fact and references.

The Triple Crown and the Grand Slam are what we have been going back and forth on.

My contention is that The Intercontinental and United States Championships are equal and thus are interchangeable when when deciding a Crown/Slam.

You say no because WWE never explicitly came out and said so.

On 8-4-06, JBL said he was a Slam winner.  A WWE wrestler on WWE TV said he accomplished a WWE sanctioned feat.

It was said that no outside source has verified this, but no one in WWE has disputed JBL's claim either.

Also it must be pointed out that PWI has always considered the two championships as equal.

When PWI used to do their rankings for WWF and WCW, the I-C and U.S. Titles were always listed as automatic number one contenders for their respective World Champions.  The same holds true today when they do the rankings for Raw (I-C) and Smackdown (U.S.).

PWI is considered the main source for what is considered a """"World Title"""" and their word is law here on Wikipedia.

They also have always maintained that the I-C and U.S. Championships are of equal value and of equal standing.

As I have said before, I am not trying to vandalize or add nonsense to Wikipedia, only enhance it with an updated definition based on consensus and fact, based on logic and references.

JBL, PWI, and many other wiki users have backed up this definition. (Look at the Triple Crown Champion Discussion page).

All I ask is my contribution be allowed to stand as I respectfully feel that I am in the right on this one.

Thank you for your time.

 Coming to an understanding 

I've done most of the lion's share of edits on this article, but I want to make it clear that my interest is in having a neutral article, and that I'm not trying to push the idea that the Seth Material is true or valid (that's a judgement that the article can't make).  For example, the first use of the word """"channeled"""" had quotes around it.  I was the one who put those quotes in, though someone else removed them.  I inserted the first instance of the word """"purportedly"""" (even though it is on the list of words to avoid) because I felt it was needed, and I have reinstated it when other editors removed it.  Someone named """"Itsmejudith"""" has just changed the word """"awareness"""" to """"the idea"""", and I support that change.  I'm mentioning these small things simply as examples to show people that the neutrality of the article is important to me.  And despite what you may have thought (speaking to Verbal now), when I substituted """"Jane Roberts, speaking as Seth, said"""" for """"the Seth personality said"""", I believed that I was making a change that was a leap forward in neutrality (since Roberts was the one who actually uttered the words).

Verbal, I would like to try to bury the hatchet and work together on this article.  Your interest in the article appears to me to be negative, but I am willing to consider the possibility that I am wrong and to see your point of view.  In order to work together, we'll have to discuss specifics of the article on this page.  We'll need to discuss individual passages as well as the broader issues of the article's size and the proportion of primary to secondary cites.  If we make a concerted effort to work together, I'm sure we can come to an understanding and improve the article.  Are you with me on this?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

6b769517ca08d6dc,"""== Entirely too much exposition for a game nobody plays ==

This entry's game-plot/storyline is longer than the combined entries for the plot/storylines of all three movies.  A few hundred fans of the game may care about its story, but this sort of overly detailed plot exposition doesn't belong in a Wikipedia article.  Smells like fans trying to save a dying game.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  
I agree, though before seeing this section I was going to suggest splitting it off into a separate article to satisfy those who disagree. I think we need a little more discussion and consensus before coming to a decision, however.  t 

Honestly I don't there is any need to """"satisfy"""" anyone who is not content with it.  The cruft is barely (if at all) notable enough to be in this article.  Never mind its own.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

I don't think obvious personal bias against this (or any game for that matter) should be a motivator for any article changes.    —Preceding comment was added at  

The obvious personal bias of a few overzealous gamers is the reason the article's so bloated with trivial data to begin with.  I'm with Ookami, this game just plain isn't notable enough to warrant a chapter by chapter breakdown of its storyline.  That's what fan sites are for.   

Just checked the World of Warcraft page out of curiosity, and even it doesn't have this much detailed story description.  In fact it barely has any, and I don't think anyone can argue which of the two games is more notable.  Also someone further up the page here brought this issue up already under 'generic story', why is this still being allowed?  

I play this game, I could care less that the huge exposition was taken out. That was an absolutely ridiculous story summary; most of the people that play the game couldn't tell you half of it. However, to kill the previous, argument, WoW barely has a story, while the Matrix Online's main content and selling point is the story. We don't need a 20 paragraph summary like before. A mention that there have been past live events, as well as a 4 sentence or so story summary, should suffice. I'd challenge one of you to do it, as I don't think any of you know anything about the game in the current state, besides that it is much weaker than World of Warcraft.   
To clarify my point above, I think the storyline section is very good now, it does, however, need the slightest mention of what has happened.   

Just for clarification, the game's main selling point was not the story itself, but that the players would be shaping the story, which never happened.  And WoW has plenty of story, enough to fill reams of Wikipages, it's just that it doesn't belong here in that great of detail.  This is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not a novel.  

Well, since there seems to be some rough consensus that this is well overdone, and that there has been no real objection to it, and pending the fact that no one with the adequate experience within the game has stepped forward to trim it down and keep whatever are the key points, I'm going to purge it.Talk|@ 
Per the anon-IP user's objection in the page history of the main article...  It doesn't matter.  Its that simple.  The story is WP:CRUFT, is a broken part of an already barely notable game , and the fact that something cannot be fixed, or that no one is willing to, does not mean you have to keep it in its current state.

Try as I might, I'm not really able to associate your Zebra analogy with this article. For it to work, this would have to be an article about the colour white, and even then it doesn't really work. The purpose of my change is to remove the """"comparison"""" nature of the section. It's not meant to be a comparison to begin with. The problem right now is that the section really violates NPOV - it places weight on a comparison with another format, rather than standing by itself. The fact it mentions Blu-ray means we have a somewhat unnecessary argument going on in the Talk: pages about a graph which is exclusively focussed on comparing Blu-ray and HD DVD studio support. 

To be NPOV, this part of the article needs to focus on what support HD DVD has. Issues such as what proportion of the studios support it are obviously relevant. Issues as to whether they support either of the competing formats (incumbent DVD, as well as Blu-ray) aren't really, except insofar as it should be mentioned that the rivaly exists.

We need to move the fanboi """"HD DVD is better"""", """"No, Blu-ray is better!"""", """"Well, HD DVD has more support!"""", """"No, Blu-ray has more support!"""" crap to the comparison articles.   18:13, 21""",0,0,0,0,0,0

For Canada and all other Commonwealth Realms (except for England itself), the monarch appoints a governor-general to take over his or her duties in the realms. Canada and any other country needs a monarchical head of state, because it's a neutral person (and not coming from any party) representing all the People and avoids the country to become a dictatorship. He or she stands for stability, democracy and justice. One only point I don't like on monarchies is that in most of present monarchies the husband of a reigning queen becomes Prince Consort instead of King Consort. That should be changed. And now to the USA: the president is not elected by the People, but by electors. Second, there are only two parties, which have real chances to become ruling parties due to the restrictions of the Constitution. And third, it has a first-past-the-post voting system like in England, which also favors the only two ruling parties. In England, it doesn't matter, because Con. Party and Lab. Party have different aims, while the Rep. and the Dem. Party have very similar aims. Only a few persons in them make exceptions such as Ron Paul, Randall Terry, Rick Santorum or Sarah Palin.

I know that the Croatian perspective is somewhat different. This comes from a very specific historiographical school, which had among its roots Grga Novak. Assuming that Dalmatia was one of the most primitive of Europe at the time of Venetian domination, we must also think that since 1797 to the date you specified (1945) they are 150 years. Josip Smodlaka stated in 1911 (1911!) that Dalmatia was still one of the poorest regions of Europe. As you can understand, we can not talk only of the Italian evil foreign rule to explain this fact.

 Comunist """"Agents"""" acting as wikipidia moderators are in fact glorifying comunism. 

I am astonished at the deep diarrhoea of Communism propaganda on articles such as this one on Fidel Castro. This criminal murderous communist (let us understand that no one is a communist only a fool can be a communist). This murderer is being glorified here in this space of wikipedia. 

Let us (at least me), we the ones that don't have the power of moderators, let us uphold reason and above all truth of facts and reality, that this pig by the name of Fidel Castro is not only a communist criminal but is a devil in its own right.

For the crimes that this pig committed and the misery that this pig inflicted in nations and peoples, may the soul of Fidel Castro burn in hell for eternity.

Hi Dmc, you have had experience with Adil Baguirov socks in the past and unfortunately, his evasion of the ban has continued relentlessly. I have collected some evidence that Adil = user:Ehud Lesar, and  would like you to check it out please. Here it is . I started adding the evidence, I will be adding more depending on how much you request if this is not enough. I am really amazed that no one sees anything in Adil's game.

 Removal of dubious material. 

I've removed the following information because it is factually incorrect.

Russell was active in the Fabian socialist movement.  His political thought was certainly very sympathetic to many technocratic ideas, but was generally more abstract than any ideology.  Roads to Freedom makes patent his political promiscuity: Russell was willing to support any movement that would tend to push history towards human freedom, humane social relations, and the rational satisfaction of human needs.  (Although when nuclear war was concerned, he seemed to prefer social injustice to complete ruin).  On the other hand, Russell was deeply skeptical of technology and science in its influence on human society and culture.  The Scientific Outlook was his vision of a scientific dystopia—one which incorporates much of technocracy.  (For the uninitiated: it is somewhat similar to Brave New World).  Although the technocratic elements are not necessarily portrayed in a negative light, they are not left blameless for the resulting society.  All in all, it seems hard to imagine that book could be the work of an enthusiastic technocrat. — 06:39, 27 January 2007",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Article Licensing 

Whenever I need a WikiVacation, sometimes I go back to working on articles that absolutely no one would think to write about so they leave me alone.

A secondary, but equally important, goal is to get those users to release ALL of their edits for ALL articles.  I've personally chosen to multi-license all of the  and  contributions under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License so that other projects, such as WikiTravel, can use our articles.  I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all your contributions (or at minimum those on the geographic articles) so that we can keep most of the articles available under the multi-license.  Many users use the {{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}} template (or even {{MultiLicensePD}} for public domain) on their user page, but there are other templates for other options at Template messages/User namespace.  If you only prefer using the GFDL, I understand, but I thought I'd at least ask, just in case, since the number of your edits is in the top 100.  If you do want to do it, simply just copy and paste one of the above two templates into your user page and it will allow us to track those users who have done it. For example:

Option 1

His previous full lupine state allowed him to lift only 1 ton.  Sabreooth can lift at least 900 lbs.

Oh Mark, for shame! Why lie? I didn't get banned from the Clitoris article for any such thing. I didn't get banned from it at all. I was banned from removing the picture that upset several editors. You pretended you had a """"unanimous"""" """"consensus"""" then too. I didn't constantly run any polls. That's a downright lie too. Why would I? I don't think polls demonstrate consensus and I oppose their use to settle content disputes. I've expressed that view many, many times. The dispute on clitoris in fact centred around a group of editors who were bullying minority-view editors because they had won a vote. They largely refused to discuss the salient issues because, they believed, they had won a vote and that was that. (Careful Tony Sidaway watchers will note that on Talk:Clitoris he was insistent that winning a vote was the same as having a consensus but on Talk:something about B roads, he had changed his tune and thought that votes were evil. Like most of the people who voted here, it's one rule when it fits your POV, another when it doesn't.) This title is shockingly POV. That you can line up a bunch of editors who share the POV that it pushes to vote and say no it's not doesn't actually not make it so, but I've given up trying to get editors to accept that the proZionist stance that is so common in your home country is not actually """"neutral"""". I advise the other editors here that their commitment to NPOV will not be rewarded, because it simply is not shared by everyone here.

It was 89.57. You rounded up. I love how have to type sentence after sentence about a subject you clearly know nothing about. It was a 27.3 m (89.5 ft) female caught off the South Shetland Islands in January 1925. Whether it was measured or not I can't say. It wasn't measured by a scientist in the standard zoological manner (in a straight line from the tip of the rostrum to the notch of the flukes) though, so it probably wasn't measured accurately (if at all). It was most likely measured alongside a factory ship during flensing (unless it was taken to the Deception Island station). This was just before the widespread use of stern slipways, so it would have been difficult to measure if it indeed was. The cited source should be Mackintosh and Wheeler (1929), which cite Risting (1928), which I don't have access to. Mackintosh and Wheeler simply say it was """"27.3 m. or 89 ft. 6 in."""" (p. 321). Risting probably originally gave it in Norwegian feet, which Mackintosh and Wheeler converted into meters and English feet to conform to their figures.

A couple of points

A. I don't think you're taking the Anonimu business too seriously, and I find Anittas' intervention rather bizarre, but the key is to keep watching and waiting, and acting when really ready. It's frustrating that he can get away with so much (and his attacks have been pointed out to a number of administrators so far).

B. I too despise the profusion of flags, especially when coupled with recentism. Take for instance a biography I was looking at today: that of Anna Politkovskaya. It starts out nicely, but once she gets shot, spirals quickly out of control. Maybe, just maybe, the assassination deserves its own article, but as for the main article, a serious, scholarly biography would never look like this, especially the """"political reaction"""" section.

C. By the way, here are the other """"international reactions"""" articles: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Some are just perhaps salvageable; with others, now that a few months have passed, """"who cares?"""" seems a more fitting reaction.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Right. So we've dealt with the question of Qworty's slander. Let's move on. Here's why you should not be involved in this discussion, Qworty. You have demonstrated - not simply to me; not simply to Wikipedia; but to THE WORLD AT LARGE - that you are incapable of editing in good faith. When the mainstream media characterizes you - Qworty - as a ranting, slanderous, biased editor, then... well, we should take that seriously.  I do hope you've read the Salon article about you? If not, let me quote: your screed was interpreted (rightly) as """"an apoplectic defense by one Wikipedia editor of actions that other Wikipedia editors labeled 'revenge editing.' There’s a lot of anger here (not to mention an unhealthy fixation with excrement!). Call me persnickety, but reading Qworty’s comments did not give me the greatest faith in Wikipedia’s internal process for building an encyclopedia of human knowledge.""""

Those aren't my words, regarding you. They are Salon's. THEY have identified you as an apoplectic, vengeful disgrace, with an unhealthy scatological fixation. So, that's what we're dealing with here: you, Qworty, as the star of an article entitled """"Wikipedia's Shame.""""

Now, Wikipedia requires that we assume good faith in our fellow editors, which I do, until the most extreme (and frankly comical) evidence points out that we're dealing with someone like you. Since we know that you will do everything within your power to sabotage any entry remotely related to Filipacchi, it's a waste of time to discuss matters of policy with you. I'm happy to debate subtle points of epistemology with almost anyone, into the wee hours of the morning - just not with you.  As for Little green rosetta: I've been giving her the benefit of the doubt. Even though she accused me - on the basis of what she termed """"behavioral and technical evidence"""" - of using sock puppets. Even though, when that proved to be false (okay, a lie), she didn't apologize, but instead came here to support your - Qworty's - frivolous snark. Despite all of this, I've given her the benefit of the doubt. Now shall we get back to the tedious matter of editing this article?

It's not 'final' yet (nor should it ever really be), and so it's not been linked into WP:RFA and associated pages. However, as you note, it does carry significant material advice to potential administrator nominees. I've used it a couple of times so far in directing people. So far, it's been received well. I guess that's the beta test ) With regards to self nom; I recommend that someone else nominate you. I've been keeping track of RfA statistics since late June. There have been 144 non-self nominations for users with more than 2,000 edits*. There have been 38 self-noms. The success rate of non-self noms is 83%. For self noms, it's 68%, a 15% difference. If you want me to nominate you, I'd be willing to consider you against . My standards to nominate are possibly the strictest around. First, you need to clear 3,000 edits. Note that those standards are for me to nominate; they do not affect how I vote on a nomination. Based on your average # of edits over the last 30 days, you should reach 3,000 edits by the end of this month. Your current average # of edits per day overall is 12.65. Over the last 30 days, it's been 33.76. 

* - I did  of 126 nominations from late June to mid-September. I found a glaring difference in the success of nominees with <2000 edits vs. >2000 edits. That's why I limited my success comparison of self/non-self noms to users with >2000 edits, as <2000 edits is a different case.

 Restricted biotech a characeristic of nanopunk?! 

The 2nd sentence in the article reads the following:
""""The genre is similar to biopunk, but describes the world where the use of biotechnologies are limited or prohibited, so only nanites and nanotechnologies are widely use (while in biopunk, bio- and nanotechnologies often coexist)""""
I'm really doubting the truth content of it. Basically I don't think that it's a characteristic of nanopunk that biotech is limited or prohibited even if some novels feature that. Additionally I'd rather say that this is a characteristic of biopunk with which a contrast is seeked here. Also """"so only nanites and nanotechnologies are widely in use"""" is a non sequitur - it's not a logical conclusion that """"only nanites"""" and nanotechnologies are widely in use because biotech is limited. Furthermore what's the """"only"""" referring to? Only in which area of life - medical? social? every?! Also I don't think it's not impossible for biotech to coexist in nanotech even though it probably (and eventually that might be a core characteristic) plays a subordinate role.
So I basically think everything about that sentence is false. I might be wrong about it (parts of it). So please post whatever you think of that here.
If there are no objections I'm gonna delete that sentence and somehow get the """"in nanopunk biotech plays a subordinate role to nanotechnology""""-part in there (which isn't really what the quoted sentence conveys).   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Re: Restoring Doright's Talk Page

In fact, I once had a user restore my talk page I had blanked in the process of archiving it. Since JayG reverted it, I assumed I was in error here and just dropped the matter.

Q.  How are the barrels rotated?

A.  The rotational force is delivered by two hydraulic drive motors operating off of both main aircraft hydraulic systems (A+B).  The motors deliver their torque to gearbox in the Hydraulic drive assembly.  This in turn delivers the force to two drive shafts.  The forward one goes to the rotor assembly on the GAU-8 itself, while the second delivers it's power to the ammunition drum.

Q.  How long is typical spin-up time?

A.  While the system is capable of operating at 4200 rounds per minute, it is limited to 3900 while installed in the aircraft.  Since the GAU-8 has 7 barrels it needs to spin at 1/7th of the firing rate.  Basically since it's rotating a touch over 550 rpm the spin-up time is almost instantaneous. 

On another point the statement on the gun gas on affecting the engines is complete rubbish.  During the firing of the GAU-8 the engines ingest so much gun gas that the engine igniters (think super spark plugs) must fire to ensure a stall does not occur.  The engines also will ingest so much soot from the firings that they need to be """"water washed"""" (have water and a mild cleaning solution misted into the engines while running at approx. 80% power) periodically to remove soot from the blades.  Anyone who has had to clean an A-10 will tell you the gun gas goes just about everywhere aft of the nose.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Before the video footage is broadcast, often there is theme music and an elaborate title page that might say """"Crisis in Canada"""" or """"Terror in Iraq"""".  Is it subtle POV to have to label every event with a title.

You say my criticism of David Shankbone is disgusting. What I find disgusting are his insensitive, uncaring, and simply awful author photos, and the egotistical ways he defends them.
And here is my response to you, David Shankbone: There's a difference between attending a public event and expecting a photo to appear for one day in a local newspaper, vs. having that event define your permanent image on a site as widely used as Wikipedia. Your animosity toward authors demonstrates your own lack of a NPOV. Your history with Sharyn November is more complicated than you describe.

No wonder it is ranked so low. I think Bogazici University's culture encourages to live isolated from the world instead of becoming integrated and competent. In the article, it is stated that the university has some connections to the US. On the other hand, anybody who has been to the US would know that competition is intense between universities and rankings are very popular (for good reason) in the US. The only way to get a good rank is to work and publish a lot as well as provide a better teaching environment without isolating from the developed countries. Bogazici University needs to learn a lot from other universities in Turkey that are ranked well, such as Istanbul Technical University and Bilkent University.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes, you do make the acoustics sound complicated above, but your explanation and mine do not differ in any testable sense, so they are the same, and IMO mine is better worded. That's the reason it sounds so much simpler!

The quote from Snitzler is very interesting in that it differs somewhat from Ramirez' version, but both are consistent with regarding it as a collaboration between Ramirez and Yepes. Collaboration can mean many things.

By both accounts this was a long, complex personal and creative relationship, of which each account is a mere snippet. Untangling them is interesting, but WP:OR and Wikipedia is not the place for it.

One reason why I didn't, is because I have no idea what that is, and another is that I am currently banned from editing until sometime in the future. If you look at what is supposed to be my userpage (I say supposed because I have a Blackberry which seems to share an IP with probably 28 million other people), you will see a whole catalogue of entries I am supposed to have edited in a negative fashionn to the extent that I was banned from making further edits. The problem is that I only edited 2 entries - for The Russell Tribunal and Stop The War. I firmly disagree with the reasons given for reverting these 2 edits - both organisations are openly anti-Israeli (and actually quite happy to be portrayed as such). I merely pointed this out. The problem with Wiki is that people who really know nothing of such entities are charged with protecting them, so the result is detrimental.Often in a language which they don't speak very well.

 Accuracy of 'quarrel' quote 

According to Ralph Keyes, the quote in the article """"I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong... No Viet Cong ever called me nigger"""" is a misquotation.  Keyes says: When Muhammad Ali refused induction into the Army, he was widely quoted as saying, “No Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” This was a perfect marriage of anti-war and anti-racist sentiment. Better yet, it came straight from the mouth of a mega-celebrity thought to possess primitive folk wisdom. The only problem is that Ali never made this comment. “It’s wasn’t really his mind-set to say something in that way,” explained Ali biographer Thomas Hauser. “The companion thought of that comment is ‘people call me nigger in this country every day.’ I never heard Ali say ‘white people in this country call me nigger.’ He would attack racism. But he wouldn’t personalize it.” Despite extensive searching by himself and others, Hauser has never found the source of “no Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” He concluded that it was just one of those things that got picked up and passed around in the 60s. It was a comment we wanted Ali to make so badly that we made it for him.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Epalela fish pond

A fish pond, or fishpond, is a controlled pond, artificial lake, or reservoir that is stocked with fish and is used in aquaculture for fish farming, or is used for recreational fishing or for ornamental purposes. In the medieval European era it was typical for monasteries and castles (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have a fish pond.

History

During the winter, supplying fresh food for a castle garrison was a constant struggle. Although meat would be available from deer parks, this couldn't supply the needs of the whole household. A fish pond provided an elegant solution. As long as there was a natural flow of water into the pond, fish required no feeding and were available all year round. There would usually be a series of ponds, with fish being moved between them as they grew.

Find any other equivalent. You guys have changed the entire subject. The fact of the matter is that you can not call ethnic groups prior to 1919 as Azerbaijani; there was no such defined identity. Why are there articles on the Dutchy? The Dutchy were more defined as a group than were the Turkic peoples living in those lands… why not plain German? And again, Parishan is using Russian and Soviet propaganda material, which maintained such a position, including for the Turks living in Armenia, to stop Turkey's expansionism… they had Turks in Nakhichevan and those in Armenia rather to adhere to an Azerbaijani identity than Turkish. But prior to the Soviet rules, those people were not identifying themselves, neither were they identified as such. I am wondering how much more can Parishan provide other than Soviet-Russian historiography which was known to be tainted when covering ethnic groups and ethno genesis, turning ethnic groups into groups that all originated from the identities forming the Union, some sort of Self-Sufficient system. This process already started during the end of the Russian Empire, Roy writes: In Azerbaijan for a brief period (the governorate of Vorontsov in the 1850s, and that of Goltsyn from 1896 to 1905), the Russians encouraged the development of an Azeri identity in order to weaken links with Iran and Turkey (The New Central Asia The Creation of Nations by Olivier Roy I.B.Tauris, (2000) p.56)

During the process, many different groups were pushed into being identified as ethnically Azerbaijani, including Kurds, who haven't until recently when groups wanted their independence requested their identity to be changed: In 1988 some 10,000 Kurds in Azerbaijan returned their Azeri identity papers to Moscow with the explicit request that their identity be changed from Azeri to Kurd. (A Modern History of the Kurds by David McDowall, I.B.Tauris (2004), p.493)

And to use Parishan’s opening, it is funny how Parishan is requesting sources for those quotes, Ulvi were you not a participant on the arbitration enforcement? How many sources were used? Parishan has probably missed references like this: In 1897 'Tatars'-which officially included most Muslim groups... (Socialism in Georgian Colors: The European Road to Social Democracy, 1883-1917, Harvard University Press (2005) p. 19)

Here, another quote missed by Parishan: In Contrast with the Armenians, the Azerbaijani national identity is very recent. In fact, the very name """"Azerbaijani"""" was not widely used until the 1930s; before that, Azerbaijani intellectuals were unsure whether they should call themselves Caucasian Turks, Muslims, Tatars or something else.  (S.Kaufmann, Modern hatred, Cornell University Press, 2001. See page 56.) 

Do I need to provide what was provided and include also newer ones? I like Eupator’s request RFC about this article, and a it’s a good idea of requesting the same for several other articles. Ulvi, your English language justification makes no sense; you could have changed for Turkic people instead of making an inaccurate move. -   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

While the """"circle notation"""" for benzene is popular in high school teaching, I have never seen a higher-level organic chemistry textbook that uses it, or met a practicing chemist who uses it.

It is overwhelmingly used in all the major chemistry journals I know, whether published by the ACS, the RCS, Elsevier, or Wiley. In my opinion, the reason is that once you go beyond benzene and start to look at heterocycles, polycyclic aromatic molecules, reactive intermediates, and reaction mechanisms, the Kekule notation makes electron counting and """"electron pushing"""" much more straightforward.

 Facts 

I think I'm finally starting to get the hang of this Finding of Fact malarkey, Brad.

The scenario: Bishonen has been focusing her energies for the last few weeks on her attempt to get an editor called Nina Green banned from Wikipedia. When Bishonen realises that Nina Green is indeed going to be banned

She posts to the arbcom page in green text: FoF perfectly normal. Arbcom pages are like little rainbows.
At the end of a talk page post about the green text, Bishonen suddenly decides to refer to it as """"dye"""":  FoF Not at all forced or contrived. Lots of people refer to text as dye. Or if they don't, they should do.
Bishonen ends her post with  """"Green dye!"""" which reads as """"Green die!"""": Fof Pure coincidence. Nina Green couldn't have been further from Bishonen's mind when she wrote """"Green dye!"""". Bishonen hadn't though of Nina Green for at least 30 seconds.

FOF: This entire sequence events: Bishonen wants Nina banned, gets what she wants, posts in green text, decides to call text """"dye"""", and ends her post for no apparent reason with """"Green dye!"""" is just a random bubble of billion-to-one-coincidence. Bishonen could just have easily chosen blue text, and it would have made perfect sense to end her post with """"Blue Pigment!"""".

Yep. I think I've got this FoF thing, now. And it certainly makes it a lot easier to understand how arbcom arrives at its decisions.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Holy crap.. Lest someone mistakenly visit a talk page, expecting to read some truth and hence be confused reading this gentleman's comment and mistaking the writer for someone who knows what they're talking about, I'd just like to point out the above explanation for the word """"handicap"""" is complete bollocks. handicap has meant """"to place at a disadvantage"""" for a long long time. According to Merriam Webster, the etymology is """"Etymology:
    obsolete English handicap, a game in which forfeit money was held in a cap, from hand in cap"""", which obviously has nothing at all to do with being """"Handy with a cap"""" or even related to the disabled. Certain individuals may have a negative connotation with the use of the term, which happens merely due to the words close association with 1960's era community welfare practices, but that is an individuals choice to associate negativity with the word, not the words fault at all.

Proposal

Look all I am saying is that the term """"Iranian"""" is a very loose term and people can get easily confused when they see this. Iranic would be a better term to use. Nontheless, there is no doubt that the Kurdish language is a bit similar to other languages such as Persian but there is also a difference as well. I am speaking as a Kurd myself. There is evidence that the Kurds have the highest chance out of all the other ethnic groups of being descendants of the Medes, all one has to do is look at lingustics. Although, it is also important to know that the Kurds have been in the middle east for a very very long time, and there have been many other empires/people as well. There have also been, for example, claims that Kurds are also descendants of the Gutians. It all boils down to what you believe, but to say that the Kurds are an Iranian people, is sort of going overboard. 

Kurds have been mentioned for a very longtime by many different people, including the Sumerians!

Nonetheless, I think there should be a change. I sort of agree with the Proposal above but I believe it can be better. Heres what I think should be written

Kurds are an ethnic group in the Middle East that inhabit adjacent parts of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syira known as Kurdistan. The Kurds speak a language known as Kurdish, which form a subgroup of the NorthWestern Iranian languages. The Kurds are known to be an Iranic people because of close linguistic and cultural ties with other Iranians. The Kurds are also known to be descendants of the Medes, according to many scholars.

Somewhere along those lines. Saying that Kurds are an """"Iranian ethnic group"""" is is vague, confusing, and somewhat mis-leading. What I wrote is a bit more clear and I wrote why they are considered an Iranic people with the sentences supporting it. Notice how I also said a language known as Kurdish. I do not know on what insane consensus that people decided it should be """"Kurdish language(s)."""" Kurdish is one language which is mainly based of two dialects, that are spoken by almost all Kurds. Those two dialects are Kurmanji and Sorani, both of which are highly similar. All Kurds regard their language as one. I am a Kurdish Sorani speaker and I can understand a Kurmanji speaker perfectly. Kurds in Turkey, Syria, and Half of Iraq speak Kurmanji. Then the other Half of Iraqi Kurdistan speak Sorani, with Kurds in Iran speaking Kurdish Sorani as well. There are also a few other dialects such as Hawrami which is spoken by about 10% of Kurds. Nonetheless, the Kurdish language is one language with 2 main dialects, both of which are highly similar to each other.

Yes, I'm sure it's possible that the many books and articles on the topic, written by various well-known authors, or found in reputable sources, are, in fact, completely wrong, but you'd have to find other reputable sources to refute them; your own personal concern with the concept is not particularly relevant.  Regarding the definition, it's pretty much the same as it was 3 months ago, and the forumulation which presents it more as perception than fact is in deference both to NPOV, and to various editors (like yourself) who were opposed to the concept that it existed at all.

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

There has been a corresponding increase in the number and popularity of

publicly hosted Web sites for sharing digital photos. But is it safe to share

personal photos ? After all, personal photos contain personal information about

you and your family, your interests and hobbies.

Safety in this context means that the personal information, which can be

identified and extracted from these photos, is both private and secure.

Private means that access to the information can be restricted to the use

of a particular person or group of people. The owner of the information

should control who has access to it.

Secure means free from danger and risk of loss, i.e., making sure that the

bad guys out there cannot access your information.

A photo-sharing Web site lets members upload and annotate photos that are

posted on its site.Some sites offer these services for free, while others charge

a fee, sometimes only for additional storage. In general, these sites make

money by charging for prints, cards, and gifts such as calendars or coffee

mugs imprinted with the photos. Members can share their photos by sending

friends and family the URL of their photo site. Sometimes, visitors must enter

a username and password in order to view your pictures. Sometimes, this

information is embedded in the URL. As more people post their pictures online,

As I said, the general re-work (to me) is fine, and WP policy and recommendation is that valid additions or re-works should NOT be undone or reverted, and most of the time I stick to that...(it's NOT my article or anyone else's)

but the problem is that you had removed the name """"Mormon"""" (or LDS) completely, as a good EXAMPLE of how RCC does NOT (officially) consider some professed """"Christian"""" groups as """"separated brethren"""".   Remember, this is a WikiPEDIA article, and NOT a dictionary definition or stub, so the thing, if anything, should be ADDED TO, and NOT taken away from. 

In other words, if you were to ELABORATE AND EXPAND on the article, I'd be your biggest fan probably, but it seems that 99% of the stuff you've done (on this article at least) is REMOVING REMOVING DELETING TAGGING TAGGING REMOVING SUPPRESSING ERASING GETTING RID OF REMOVING...and it gets a bit annoying and unnerving, that even WELL-SOURCED THINGS, like the Mormon matter, gets removed by you.    It was bad enough that you manuevered the removal about """"Anti-Catholic rejection of 'separated brethren' concept"""" cuz arguably it was not very well-sourced, but the Mormon thing (which IS a big thing in Roman Catholic positions and apologetics) to be obscured by you too?

aab97c4af3156525,"""Revisiting neutrality on the Clinton entry==
I edited some content about the Richard Mellon Scape adversarial relationship with Clinton that dogged his career for 8 years and even after he left office. Many of the controversies raised during Clinton's term were a DIRECT result of the Scape Arkansas Project and to see any reference to Richard Mellon Scape's part in Clinton's troubles just """"disappear"""" seems like a very """"right-wing-view"""" sanitization of the Wikipedia. 
As the, arguably, most important adversary of Clinton for a lengthy portion of Clinton's political career, to obliterate any mention of this relationship comes close to censorship.
R.M. Scape is one of two very large and looming forces at work in American politics in the early 21st century, the other being George Soros on the left. Their fingerprints, from behind the curtain, certainly draw analogies to the Wizard(s) of Oz.
Please note that I did not vote for Clinton either time, being somewhat more conservative, but I have noticed an apparent right shifted bias developing in areas that touch upon politically related items in the Wikipedia lately - and """"it ain't good"""" as they say. 

This slow erosion of complete disclosure concerning what is stylized as """"right wing leaning"""" viewpoints and the retention of those things which critisize """"left wing leaning"""" viewpoints is subtle but steady - not just here, but across many places on the Wikipedia. While they make me smile sometimes, my inclination toward keeping Wikipedia neutral reins in my mirth.

I would encourage the group to rethink the neutrality of Wikipedia & work very hard to balance the influences on both sides to prevent any more of this """"shading"""" of the Wikipedia.

I know it is very hard to remain absolutely objective but it is imperative that we do so in order to remain a respected source. To remain COMPLETELY factual without opinionated bias, it seems to me Wikipedia should error on the side of INclusion rather than EXclusion.

 I interpret it as that as we have sources that are conflicting on basic information. While each of the sources appears reliable enough none of them can be reliably, and verifiability, traced back to either reports written by the people involved with the operation or someone that interviewed them. There does seem to be wide agreement that OBL was hit twice with the first shot being somewhere in the chest/trunk (depending on the report), and the second in the head. There are conflicting reports on the number of shooters and the number of shots fired.

 We have a couple of options for the article. 1) Only report those items that seem to have wide agreement and to be silent on those details where our sources offer conflicting data. 2) Document the conflicting details along with the sources. I'd personally go with #1 as it'll be a cleaner article. We'd have a constant battle with people trying to inject a POV such as """"OBL was shot twice by one person - look at all these sources.""""

 I have a personal concern with the New Yorker version of the events in that it mentions the assault team blowing their way through doors and walls. For the first couple of days after the mission it appeared the public was allowed to wander around the compound and were only restricted from the innermost courtyard. Lots of people took photos. I never saw a photo of a hole blown into a wall nor did I see any apparent damage to the doors. Visible evidence of the assault would have been of great interest and no one took a photo? Thus, I'd say the New Yorker and other articles article is wrong on that detail. The assault team likely found the inner doors were unlocked and/or scaled the walls to get into the compound and to move between the walled off sections of the compound.

 There are other concerns about the New Yorker article in that it switches from great detail which appears to build credibility and the impression that this is an """"inside account"""" to an absence of information on basic things such as what team #1 was doing immediately after they landed. I suspect the entire thing was spun together out of speculative opinions by others. Unfortunately, many of the articles about this incident have similar issues. |talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link

Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warming's alleged impact on hurricanes.

“The [computer] models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us,"""" said Emanuel, whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear.

He told the New York Times. """"There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing. Hard to know which to believe yet.”

In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming.

His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.

""""First, 2007 turned out to be the ‘tipping point’ for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears.

“Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of man-made climate fears.”

I have provided some citations in Rajus page which are taken from famous hostorical books from famous historians.
There are more historical books which give more mistory and glory about this Kshatriya Raju caste, but due to time constraint I am not able to pick them all. 
It is unfortunate that Mr Sitush is removing citations from historical persons, and citing some odd quotations from infamous/ left out historical books. Mr Sitush has removed citation from  The History of Andhra Country, Yashoda Devi. Yashoda Devi is a famous historian. Please check about Historian Yashoda Devi and her book.

Its seems there is some allergy for Mr Sitush in accepting Rajus as Kshatriyas which is making him to remove valuable historical content on Rajus page. Please cross check the WP you would come to know.

Hi Lulubyrd, would you be so kind as strike out or remove your post for the reasons I explained in the ANI thread? (Reader's digest version: because it's not true, I even gave you a diff, and because I'm bothered you'd say such things). If you would do, then perhaps I owe you an apology for not WP:AGFing and assuming you wouldn't. It's not like our paths will cross very often, if ever, but why not score another friend?

Like you said in the article talk, the sources I cited didn't support """"Sabbatic Witchcraft"""", and... hey now, believe it or not, I was aware of that. You are welcome. Polemics make it difficult to communicate effectively.. there was no dispute, and no good options... but if you had renamed the article Sabbatic Craft, no one would have undone it. Better still, if you had suggested deletion and mentioned there was already a writeup in Contemporary witchcraft, I would have been behind that 100%, (even just mentioning the latter, I'd have suggested the former), with redirect 'natch.

""""Sabbatic Current"""" works ok as a section header, but because it's so obscure, it couldn't be used for the article per the guidelines for WP:TITLE, and while """"Sabbatic Craft"""" would have been better in that regard, it's supposed to be proprietary—the kanundrum... In addition to struggling with the guideline, I was trying to find a way to go by what Chumbley said too... and that's consistent with what you thought WP should do, yes?

Do you have any concerns with the redirects for Sabbatic witchcraft and Sabbatic Craft?

It's a sure bet you know way more about Sabbatic Craft than I intend to learn. What did you think of the changes I made to Contemporary witchcraft#Sabbatic Current? Is there a particular section in the Chumbley article that would be good to point the Cultus Sabbati redirect to? (My impression was none in particular, but I only read it once through).

Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult?

 more NPOV issues 

This article is pretty sloppy, as I think most people can tell.  I took out the section on first cause as revised by Nodem, which went beyond just poor style and outright called one side of the debate fallacious, which isn't really appropriate in an article on a philosophical topic.

Maybe I went a bit far?  I just object to statements like, the entirety of space-time came into existence at some point, unless you define this point embedded in a larger space-time outside of our own. The fallacy comes from implying that both the statements, space-time is everything, and something exists outside of space-time, are true. However, I work in computer software and don't do physics (although this is really about philosophy), so maybe I'm just using the the wrong kind of logic?  

If time is finite, then there must be a beginning (which is what I think is meant by """"at some point"""").  I don't think the phrase """"came into existence at some point"""" necessarily implies any metaphysical cause (ie: thing/being 'outside' the universe), does it?  06:59, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I wasn't really comfortable with the version that came before it, though.  First cause is a complex topic, or at least a lot has been said about it, and the previous version of the paragraph was presenting a rather severe dichotomy.  If someone could write a good article about the first cause debate, and maybe link to it from this article, that would be good.  I'm not really qualified to do it.

Also, and I haven't made an edit about this, I'm uncomfortable, as a physicist, with the statement that most astronomers hold to scientific determinism.  While many do, and they may be right, I can tell you that by far the dominant interpretation of quantum mechanics in physics circles is a nondeterministic one.  Oops!  forgot to login.  I'm misterbailey if anyone was wondering.

You are right to question the most astronomers bitI'll put in a qualifier about macroscopic forces.  I've been working on deterministic system (philosophy), where I put a bit more about quantum physics and determinism, but it is a complex subject.    

I agree that it would be nice if there were a separate article on first causes.  And I agree that this article is sort of sloppy.    Perhaps subheadings could be a first step to clearing it up?

Andy, if you are so keen, then you are encouraged to make the improvements.  These contributions are inferior in many ways as is being widely discussed not only by myself but others.  The rest of us have day jobs, so limited time to contribute.  As you probably know from your teaching experiences, repairing student essays take hours of effort and time.  Sincerely said, I just dont think that these unsupervised contributions from students are of the technical or stylistic standards we are accustomed to in Wikipedia.  The graphics are copyright violations, the article are often violate WP:NOTTEXTBOOK and are preachy or making value judgements.  The referencing ignores WP:SECONDARY.  If you find these massive additions, salvageable, then you can join the completely absent instructor in editing.  We really hope that you can help with content!    
I find your mass removal of good faith contributions by new editors, and your repeatedly pejorative descriptions of them, both outwith the spirit of Wikipedia (WP:BITE, WP:AGF), and disruptive (WP:POINT). If you are too busy to make fixes, that's OK, you are not personally required to do so - just leave the material for others to fix.  (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 
As I have already indicated, at that stage in my traiing would have submitted similarly awful essays. So my pejorative comments are directed at the so-called ambassadors-coordinators-instructors who foster and protect such inappropriate and poorly crafted content.  Like you, they are waiting and praying for someone with writing skills to intervene.  But as you're discovering, determined mediocrity can be difficult to rectify within the fringes of Wikipedia.  Looking forward to your help with editing these and other articles.   
Those people may have been your intended targets, but that's quite clearly not the result you achieved; here as elsewhere. And no, I do not pray.  (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 
There is no result to be achieved ... the students dropped their essay bomb on Wikipedia and got their grades.  The ambassadors-coordinators-instructors are flush with approval that they are """"encouraging"""" and """"nuturing"""" and being innovative in their engagement of Wikipedia.

Additionally, for the idea to work, SlimVirgin and CBerlet, whose POV is every bit as partisan as mine, would necessarily also have to agree to withdraw.

Your donation will fund Wikia, Inc., which is not a charity. Your non-profit donation will ultimately line the for-profit pockets of Jimmy Wales, Amazon, Google, the Bessemer Partners, and other corporate beneficiaries. How? Wikipedia is a commercial traffic engine. As of December 2008, there are over 14,700 external links from Wikipedia to Wales' Wikia.com sites, which are funded by Google AdSense revenues. Did you know that Amazon invested $10,000,000 in the for-profit Wikia venture? It's therefore rather interesting that there are over 43,000 links to Amazon's retail site from the supposedly non-profit Wikipedia site. Isn't it? Meanwhile, did you know that the popular movie site IMDB.com is owned by Amazon, and you can buy Amazon products directly from IMDB pages? Well, surprise surprise  there are nearly 174,000 links to Amazon's IMDB site from Wikipedia. No wonder Amazon particularly wished to invest in Wikia, Inc. Its co-founder makes sure that the external linking environment on Wikipedia is hospitable for the Amazon link spamming machine! 

Now here is the really fascinating thing. If you go to Jimmy Wales' """"talk page"""" on Wikipedia, and you ask him whether he feels that this obscene number of links to his for-profit site and those of his investors might be a conflict of interest or self-dealing, Jimbo won't even have time to respond.

 Scarborough Nicknames 

While I don't really want to expand on this section, there are in fact some web references to Scompton:

You know you're from Scarborugh when...
Busta Rules

There is also a wikipedia page called Canadian slang which references Scompton as well as a couple of other nicknames not mentioned in the Scarborough article. I used Clusty search engine to find these references. Up to you whether you want to put this reference back. I don't care one way or the other.

Regards,  

You're absolutely correct.  Serves me right for editing before my first cup of coffee in the morning.  I found nothing relevant for Scompton, but when I redid the search later, I did get results thru a search for Scompton AND Scarborough. I ought not to have deleted the entry based on a Google search turning up nothing.Personally, I generally don't see any value in having a section for nicknames for the municipality.  But there is obviously precedent for having it (e.g. Toronto).  The problem I have with these sections is that they end up including obvious entries (like """"Hogtown"""" for Toronto), but then also up end up including nicknames that may be used in some circles but don't have particularly wide usage.  The particular problem here in the Scarborough article is that so many of the nicknames have such a negative connotation  perhaps that's just a reflection of public perception, but I do believe that it does, to a degree, give the reader the wrong impression of the place.  Frankly, I am just waiting for someone to add """"Scandahar"""" to the list. I'm not from Scarborough, so I will leave the list in the hands of folks who have a better sense of whether its inclusion is justified.

I'm struggling to see what the current dispute is about after my enforced spell in the slammer.  Karbinski argues for """"Philosophy is the science that studies the fundamental aspects of the nature of existence in order to provide man with a comprehensive view of life. Major branches of Philosophy include Metaphysics, Epistemology, Ethics, Politics, and Aesthetics. The word philosophy is of Ancient Greek origin: φιλοσοφία (philosophía), meaning """"love of knowledge"""", """"love of wisdom""""""""

I prefer a return to the main four branches.  Deleting the 'reasoned argument' part is not supported by the sources, of which there are plenty.  Philosophy would be a science in the original meaning of 'science' (scientia) but the modern meaning, while not entirely different, has connotations that it would be best to avoid.  On whether the philosophy of language belongs in the main branches, that is debateable.  My view, given the dominance of the 'Old Logic' (the Categories and On Interpretation) and of the importance of those two to the Metaphysics, I would say it does belong.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Essex, Vermont as a City
Hi, thanks for your note. As I understand it its a municiple, political difference. City status doesn't automaticly come with size. This is clearer in the UK where there has to be a cathedral, a university and other factors (such as population size), then the Queen grants """"city"""" status. Here in the US I think its a little less rigorous, but the State grants the city """"status"""" if the town and state desire. I'm not sure what that status brings with it, but its likely to change the way the place is administered / financed and governed. I hope this helps  

According to the Vermont Citizens' Guide, (published by the Vermont League of Women Voters), """"The usual connotation of a city as a densely populated urban area is alien to Vermont.  Of the thirty largest local government units, only eight hold city charters and one must continue down the list to the 72nd largest community before reaching the ninth City of Vergennes with a population of 2,741 ... It is the form of government, not population, which distinguishes Vermont cities from towns.""""  Thus, it seems that something in Vermont is a city if and only if it has a city charter.

 Epiwafer 

I am surprised to learn that """"epiwafer"""" was a popular term right around 2000-2002, the exact time that my company started to use epi wafers.  I should pay more attention to ads, I guess.  Anyway, it quickly settled back to more normal terminology, like """"epitaxial wafer"""", looks like.  I guess another move is in order.    

Hi , I think it best to look at all those Google searches on the Talk page, and see which spelling/nomenclature  adding the web + book, singular + plural spellings (that's four searches for each spelling)  has the most hits, for the title of the article. If you want, I can do that and add them up. Of course, the company name will skew """"epiwafer"""" so we can exclude that if you like.   
We don't use plurals, and book searches are generally more authoritative than web searches, but feel free to provide more data.    
Plurals are for the Google searches, because obviously many of the mentions (even in books) are only in plural, not singular, so an exact-phrase Google search (i.e., in quotation marks) will omit those mentions unless a plural form is searched. I'm fine with the fully spelled-out version as long as all of the other spellings redirect to it; therefore should probably also create a redirect for Epi-wafer, since that hyphenated form is sometimes used as well.   
Yes, good point(s).    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes and no. Yes because, well, it's a technical decision made by the developers; they change the config files at the direction of their bosses, the userrights change. In theory, it is a decision we could make without consulting the community. In practise - look, I've been an editor for 6+ years now, most of those as just an editor (I've been contracted here for, I think, 9 months and change). I know how silly a decision that'd be, both for practical reasons (people would get totally up in arms about it, and for good reason) and ethical ones (we owe a duty to involve editors in decisionmaking wherever we can, because we're a bottom-up organisation, not a top-down one). So generally speaking, I think editors should be able to disagree and I think editors should at least be asked their opinion before a change is made. That's what I believe, and that's why I held that RfC.
That's also why arguing with me is likely to be futile ). Not because this is a WMF decision, not because this is my staff account, but because we asked people what they want and they said """"give this to rollbackers too"""". I believe this was a perfectly valid expression of the community's opinion on the subject, and that it's much more applicable than the 2008 RfC, which was held when the community was in a much different state, addressing an (in some respects) radically different question, and not explicitly prohibiting these actions. So I'm not going to be persuaded by appeals to that, and it's not me you should be looking to persuade - if you want the situation to change, as said, hold your own. If you don't want to do that, I'm stuck in a situation, hired as a person to ensure the community was listened to, where the only way out is to ignore the opinions of those editors who spoke up when presented with the opportunity.

 BLACK DAHLIA MURDER IS NOT 'MELODIC DEATH METAL'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE DEATHCORE PUSSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Black Dahlia Murder IS NOT Melodic Death Metal. They are the farthest band from that genre. Black Dahlia Murder are pieces of shit scene bitches that are trying to be """"METAL"""" along with all of the other Deathcore/Grindcore bands like Job For A Cowboy, Suicide Silence, etc. Fuck all of them! They aren't true Metal and they never will be, they need to stick to what they know...American Eagle, MTV, and all of their other lame trends. Melodic Death Metal is Scar Symmetry, In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Disarmonia Mundi. Melodic Death Metal is REAL music, it's not a disgrace to music like Deathcore and Grindcore.

I will continue to change Black Dahlia CUNT'Murder's genre to Deathcore/Grindcore, I don't give a shit..I'm not letting you stupid scene bitches take away the only thing that you and the Mainstream hasn't destroyed and that's the amazing genre of Melodic Death Metal. So fuck all of you trendy conformists, go fucking die.

Black Dahlia Murder are Deathcore pussies that need to be beheaded, them and all of the other Deathcore bands that are ruining Metal.

Deathcore is the biggest piece of shit I've ever heard...it shouldn't even be considered music, it's a bunch of pussy scene kids trying to be """"METAL"""". Deathcore and Grindcore are the two worst forms of music ever invented.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the Guitar while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs.

""""DA...THIS SONG IS CALLED BIG FUCKING TREE!""""

""""Ya boi....we are so down wit American Eagle..ya boi, my hair does that flippy thing.. RAWR RAWR RAWR I'M SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! GAGES AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR""""

Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit.

Melodic Death Metal owns all. 

There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band.

So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME.""""

Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A Cowboy's vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from Black Dahlia Murder, there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, White Chapel actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and Grindcore bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!!

But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days.

I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on Earth...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm.

Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""".

They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""".

I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""".

Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in.

YA BOI! LETS HARDCORE DANCE! RAHHHH YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Grindcore and Deathcore isn't Metal so all you douchebags should just give up....you aren't Metal and you never will be, go fall into a pool of AID's. 

Fuck Black Dahlia Murder, I'm not giving up....this is insane, I'm not letting you mother fuckers take away the one thing I have that you haven't ruined.""",1,0,1,0,1,0

Tajik, you're the only party still unable to come into terms with what's on the Safavid page right now. We agreed with various contributors over and over on the wording.

So that edit must say: Turkic-speaking dynasty for all practical purposes as agreed with Ali and many others earlier.
Ismail was of mixed Azeri Turkic, Kurdish and Pontic Greek identity. Your race approach is not acceptable. There is no such identity as """"Iranic"""", but Iranian, secondly, I am not sure if Kurdish contributors will be happy with replacement of the word Kurdish with the word Iranian, but it's up to them. 
The claim """"reasserted original Iranian identity"""" is void of references and baseless. Ismail asserted Shiite identity, which is modern Iranian identity, original Iranian identity was not Shiite but Zoroastrian, which was a herecy for Ismail and Safavids.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Aminz, moving the article specifically will not really clear the misconception. People who don't want to believe the figures are the same will always do that. But in Wikipedia, we can use the actual name for Isa as the Islamic figure that exists in his own importance. It doesn't mean that if a figure also exists in Christianity too that this figure becomes only an article based on the perspective. Isa in his own self can have an article just like Yeahua and Jesu that do exist. It's not simply one perspective of that same person, it's a different belief and the entire reason why the articles is here in the first place. It isn't simply a fact that because a figure exists in two religions that we can not have the real name of the figure being used as the name.

e5958ff908c56447,""": I would just add that unless a stub is clearly vanity or garbage, adding a VfD within minutes after the entry is posted is not a very good practice for several reasons.  While schools are inherently controversial here at Wikipedia, I would urge you to apply the same wait-and-see approach across the board. The whole purpose of a stub is to act as an invitation to create an article.  Frequently, it is difficult to tell whether the subject is encyclopedic.  I have seen many good articles start as stubs.  For example, a stub may start as """"John Q. Unknown was an American politician"""" and it may turn out that he was a Territorial governor, U.S. Senator and later president of a well known college.  Unless the subject of a stub is very well known, it is a rare stub that gives enough detail to know immediately whether the subject has the potential to become encylcopedic.
 You may have already seen these, but I would refer you to Wikipedia:Stub and Wikipedia:Deletion policy. The deletion policy states that among the problems which do not require deletion are a stub with potential (which should be expanded) or a minor branch of a subject that doesn't deserve its own article (which should be merged, with a redirect to the new location).

f9adfc94b7a536d2,"""lol. Regardless of intent or accident - I actually wish that GoingBatty would listen to my request and avoid pages that I'm working on. GoingBatty was (and still is) not interested in  Brazilian Hip Hop unless he's a secret gangster rapper. Maybe after a hard day in the hood with his scout charges this scoutmaster relaxes by expressing himself through rap. Anyway I'm bored by him and a whole bunch of other editors - all of whom seem to be here either as incognito moralists, conservatives, protectors of childhood, nationalists, etc. I imagine that many of the neo-nazi groups are here also. Its my experience of right-wingers that on the whole they don't want you to know what they are up too. I remember an arts center open mic night which I was attending being infiltrated by five or six or them. It was a surreal situation because none of them were actually musicians - they pretended to be comedians which allowed them the right to attend and perform. The woman who ran the night and who had no idea of how the BNP (British National Party) worked had put one of them in charge. I emailed the arts center due to the fact that I knew some of the people who ran the open mic nights (including the woman who had been put in overall charge and had made the decision to put him in charge) and got an email back saying the open mic nights were for everyone regardless of their political views. A week or two later I received another email saying that the arts center had decided to separate the comedy from the music by having separate nights for both. I'm  not too sure why but I do know that at one of the open mic nights the leader of this small BNP cell had been put in charge and after one of the singers had finished (she was colored) he said something that was really strange. I can't say what because people who were there may be reading this but it was racist. About a hundred people witnessed and heard what he said and everyone just sat silently in shock not knowing how to react - after all he was in charge. Now that is power. When you can persuade others that your intent is one thing and then position yourself to impose your will or views upon those who believe your original lie - well that is political power. Its not even a right wing thing since many left wing leaders have used to same ploy. It is the nature of a dogmatic personality who is seeking power to follow such a course when faced with opposition to their dogma. Here's what happened after the torrent scene released the membership list of the BNP and I spotted that one of them was a town planning consultant employed by my local council. I sent an email to my council of course. Evidently my council believe that hiring a BNP member as a town planning consultant for one of the most highly diverse ethnic towns in England was fine because his racist views shouldn't affect his ability to provide good advice. lol

 One Corpse Too Many  vandalism of reference's url 

Thanks for all your changes to spelling, date formats, use of dashes, etc in this entry.  I did not appreciate that you randomly altered part of the long string that is the url for Ref 8 in the article.  I have fixed it now, so the link goes directly to the google book of the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica article on Shrewsbury Castle, on page 1022.  Please leave that unchanged.

I do not understand why you are undoing links to the 'year in literature' articles, and to the 'year in British television' articles.  It took me time to get each book in its proper year, and to make sure the television adaptations were correctly described as to series, episode and year, and matching that overall page as well as IMDb information.  Not every novel was adapted for television. So I put those links back, for consistency across The Cadfael Chronicles articles in Wikipedia, the 20 novels and one short story collection.  

Is this some new rule in Wikipedia, though the articles for the year in literature and year in television still exist?

Stop adding so much unnecessary edits to the C train article. I don't know why you're going into more detail about the R32s. It's just a damn train. Nobody cares how often a train breaks down or whatever issues it has. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a Mean Distance Between Failures figure about how often any train break downs or whatever. Besides, the C train and the R32 car articles already mentions the breakdown rates anyway, just in a more subtle way. All it matters is just simply saying that the R32s were moved to outdoor lines to save their aging air compressors from having to work underground all the time. That's it. There's no need to mention what kind of issues the cars themselves have nor how they are/were solved. At least, in my book, your edits to the C train article were either completely over-opinionated, unsourced, or both, and thus, are not needed to mention. It's not like you work for the MTA anyway, so don't speculate about railcar maintenance, inspection or issues.

No, if you go by the journal's homepage, which not even mentions the word """"environmental"""".

-Chess forces personal views, not supported by science

Wikipedia user -Chess participates in vandalism the following way:

Over and over again the Wikipedia user -Chess has been asked on this discussion page to present a known historian or another acceptable source, quote or reference to back up his claims, for instance about his """"16th century"""" Finnish migration theory to Northern Norway, etc.

-Chess has refused to respond to any of these pleas for sources.  Now, that Mr. Chess has changed the Kven text to reflect his personal theories - which are not supported by science - he is attempting to lock and protect the site from reverts and/or further edits.

The Wikipedia user -Chess is forcing his personal views into the Wikipedia Kven text.  Those views are not supported by science.  Not willing to present any sources for the peaces of information inserted by him, the Wikipedia user -Chess is participating in vandalism.

Let it be known, that most parts of the Wikipedia Kven text remaining as of today, which were left standing from earlier contributors, seem accurate.  However, Mr. Chess has attempted to include into the text some of his own ideas, which do not seem to match the opinions of any known historians.  

If Fred Chess disagrees, we once again ask him to provide sources for his claims - even just one source, which could be considered distinguished and reliable.

In his earlier discussion comment above, Fred Chess praises and thanks a respond from user .  However, even that commentator sides against Fred Chess, who - without any scientific foundation, or without any sources presented - tries to present the Northern Norwegian Kvens as a separate and totally non-connected group from the medieval Kvens of Northern Scandinavia.

Wikipedia user  correctly states:  """"Of course, the present Kvens in Northern Norway have a connection with the Finnish-speaking medieval settlers in Northern Sweden and Finland.""""

, March 22, 2006

Vandalism by 

Below are three misquotations by user , from his unsigned message above (his previously used IP address 130.234.75.167 shows that the message is his): 

Claim Number One: """"Tavastians (a group of Southern Finns) were present on the Arctic Ocean alreydy during the Viking Age"""".

Claim Number Two: """"Some believe that the Kvens were the original inhabitants of Northern Norway"""".

Claim Number Three: """" According to Ottar, the Kvens were living in Northern Norway and around the White Sea"""".

When you choose to quote someone, please use the copy and paste technique.  No one has said any of the three sentences above.  You simply changed the wording, to make up goofy sounding sentences, which you claim some one actually wrote.  

Please, explain:  When and where were those sentences written ?  You are simply participating in vandalism, aren't you.  

You've also changed the content of a comment written by another Wikipedia user to this discussion page (and we do not mean you placing your responses between the lines, although for that too you ought to ask a permission from the writer of the comment).

At 13:45, 19 March 2006, using the IP address 130.234.5.136 you added the following sentence to the text which another Wikipedia user had written under the headline Lack of public funding a major cause for lack of information:

""""It's not going to happen, however.""""  You did not return to fix that act of vandalism which you published as a page http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kven&oldid;=44501610.

You did not write that sentence in italic text, nor did you margin that sentence with your text, as you did all your other parts of your comments.  Purposely or not, you made it appear as if the other party would have written that comment.  

From here on - to avoid further such temptations and/or accidents - please refrain from placing your comments in between the lines written by other participants on this discussion forum.

 POV Yahweh Vocalization Side-note 

Hello Cush. Just replied to your latest reply to me in the Talk:Yahweh page, and I wanted to add a personal side-note to that. I don't think we actually disagree on what I was saying, I may just not be explaining my thought clearly enough. I have generally noted that you and PiCo are — for the most part — on the same page as I am on cleaning up the Y article.

Now that we have finally removed the behemoth sections about the vocalization that use to be in the article, I want to be vigilant about making sure all that does not creep back in. That discussion should, instead, go to the Tetra""""n article, and that any discussion about the vocalization that remains within the Y article be kept to a absolute minimum (only present where really necessary, not going into much detail about it) and that it be neutral about that discussion (if people want to know more about it, they can go to the Tetra""""n article for it).

That's a basic summary, and I get the feeling that you agree with these thoughts. —    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 2008 BATTLE of KODORI 

Abkhaz separatists strike disputed Georgia gorge

Posted 11 hours 29 minutes ago

Abkhazia has said it has launched an operation to drive Georgia out of a disputed gorge, possibly opening a """"second front"""" in Tbilisi's battle to retain fractious breakaway regions.

The separatist foreign minister Sergei Shamba said Abkhazian artillery and warplanes struck Georgian forces in Kodori, a narrow gorge which cuts deep into the Abkhazian territory and is an ideal route for any invasion in the region.

The attack came less than 48 hours after Georgia sent troops to retake the breakaway province of South Ossetia, triggering an invasion of Russian forces dispatched to restore the status quo.

""""Abkhazian forces, in response to the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia, have started a military operation the Kodori gorge to clear it from illegal Georgian troops,"""" Mr Shamba told Reuters.

Mr Shamba said at midday (local time) Abkhaz warplanes launched airstrikes at the Tbilisi-controlled upper part of the Gorge and artillery was pounding the area.

""""Today was only the initial part of the operation by heavy artillery supported by aviation,"""" Mr Shamba said.

Georgians denied an all-out Abkhaz attack and said they were ready to face down any aggression.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Underhill et al: 20 groups based on Y chromosome

{The following is extracted from the archives, mainly for 195. The referenced article is readily available online at http://www2.smumn.edu/uasal/DNAWWW/pdfs/Underhill2000.pdf

Here is a summary of a phylogenetic tree based on analysis of the Y chromosomes of 1062 individuals from around the world. The tree comes from . It has 20 population clusters, but only captures 18% of the variation in the haplotypes. (That is, many of the haplotypes are spread in various ways amongst the identified groups. The details are given in a table in the paper.)

Underhill et al did not have adequate data on New Guinea and Australia, and so created a single group for them all. It looks as though they may have missed some interesting areas altogether.

In the following:

    * """"X, Y"""" means X and Y are leaves that are directly joined together;
    * A+B is just the name of a single group. 

The tree has three main lobes (A,B,C):

 A. Sardinia
    Sudan, Ethiopia
 B. America
    Mali
    Khoisan
    S.Africa, C.Africa
    New Guinea/Australia (grouped for lack of data)

I understand the confusion. You would think that since a primary source is a first-hand account, it would be the most reliable. However, the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint. Also, there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another. That's when a secondary source comes in. A secondary source's author is """"one step removed"""" from the event reducing the chance of bias, and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion, evaluation, and/or conclusion. Furthermore, secondary sources are more likely to be published – the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here. It helps us avoid original research. One of the biggest problems with Wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions, whether intentionally or not, which would be considered original research.

I agree with the Postcode and """"Boxing the Compass"""" change, its the official_name parameter that I disagree with.

Myself and another editor are having a drive on Sussex stubs by merging one line village articles into a larger parish based article, based on guidelines at WikiProject UK geography. This means that the Laughton article is about the wider ranging Parish of Laughton and not just Laughton village. To emphasise that, I used Laughton Civil Parish as the official name. In addition, the population and area statistics relate to the Parish and not just the village. I have done this on quite a few places now!

OK, the Catholicism tag is part of the Christianity tag because of my trying to integrate all of them. The question of the Vatican City, Rome, and Italy is a good one. I can see having one """"Italy"""" tag with a drop-down for Rome and maybe another for Vatican City, and personally think that would probably be the way to go. Unfortunately, my machine got stolen last night which is likely going to seriously damage my own ability to combine those banners. I don't think this machine even has the tildes to do a signature, so I'm going to have to tell you by hand that this is John Carter. What you might consider doing is asking the Rome project to become a subproject of Italy, or, if it is inactive, just merge the banners yourself. As more or less the only active Vatican member, I don't think that there would be any objections to merging it into the Italy banner either. John Carter""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Please do not use talk pages ... for general discussion of the topic. They are
for discussion related to improving the article. They are not to be used as a
forum or chat. If you continue to use talk pages as you do, you may be blocked
from editing. You are using the talk page to push a POV rather than addressing
the article in a constructive manner. Please stop.

I AM NOT """"generally discussing a topic"""", I AM NOT """"chatting"""". I AM NOT
""""pushing a P.O.V."""".  If you do not understand basic English grammar, you have
no business telling me anything.  FACT: commas are used in this context to
separate a list, a series, of related clauses.  Grammar is not a matter of a
""""general discussion"""" or """"chatting"""" or a """"point of view"""".  It is a technically
precise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate that
the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT
IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING
ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help.

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, ...
having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.
But you should ... stop if there is any objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and
been fourteen Years a Resident within the United
States.

A tag has been placed on Magnus howie requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hi thanks for taking the time to respond Avi.  I had presumed you were Muslim because it said on your talkpage that you had contributed to the Abbey Hill Mosque article.  From your response I now gather you are of the Jewish faith so sorry if I have misrepresented you at any point. Have I got that right, you are Jewish, not Muslim? I also presumed you were from the UK (which is where I am from) because you had contributed to an article on a UK mosque.  Is that right?
When I said most people are against it I meant that most people where I am from don't know much about it and if they did find out about the negative aspects of it (such as the complications (serious and minor), loss in sexual function, etc) then they would most likely take a somewhat negative view of it. I would apply this to all non-circumcising cultures.  These people may not campaign against it or join the genital integrity movement (if you could describe it as such), however they would in general have a negative view of it.  There are a few reasons as to why I think they'd view it somewhat negatively once you forced them to give their view on it. 
It is done on children without their consent.  Most people would view this as ethically wrong - to not have any say in a major alteration to a part of your body (a particularly sensitive part at that).  
It can cause pain (people generally don't like to see children in pain).  
They then might ask if there was a reason for it to be done.  They would look at the views of the medical associations (via their policy statements on RIC) and find out that it isn't a net positive operation, therefore it doesn't need to be done for health reasons.  Furthermore, those that are not circumcised would realise it is a needless operation because they had done fine being intact.
 What I am saying is that most people do view it negatively (if they know about it and are forced to choose), they just don't bother saying anything because they do not wish to cause upset to a religious community or be accused of being intolerant.  
 I am not sure what bizarre forced circumcision you are referring to.
 Regarding the term/title of the article, I don't see how calling the article Male circumcision would equate it with female circumcision.  I realise they are different operations, but they still involve cutting of the genitals.  You also cannot deny that a lot of people refer to FGM (as you would call it) as female circumcision.  Furthermore, a lot of people, when asked to define """"circumcision"""" would ask the question, """"which type? Male or female?"""" In the last post on this subject, at talk:circumcision, I said this and I don't think you or Jake responded.  I took that as meaning you didn't have a counter-argument to what I said.  My point there was that we should be as specific as possible and that being accurate is more important than using the most widely used term.  This is following the Wikipedia naming guidelines.

4c2d47e317da0f34,"As with all coins, the value depends on the condition of a coin, its rarity, and the state of the market  the rarest coin will be worth nothing if no-one wants to buy it where it is being offered for sale.

That said, the British grading system for coins works like this (I will not touch the lunatic American grading system with 70 different grades!):-

 Poor coins are very worn, and most of the detail of the coin will have gone, but you're still able to tell what type of coin it is.
 Fair coins are well worn, but more of the detail of the coin is visible, and it is easy to identify the coin.
 Good coins will have almost all the lettering readable, and the date will be easy to read in most cases.
 Very Good coins  will have all the coin readable, and some of the finer details of the design can start to be made out.
 Fine coins will have the details of the coins taking shape, and the coin is starting to become collectable if it's fairly recent.
 Very Fine coins will have all the details clear, and there will be wear only on the high points of the design, and most of the fine details shows clearly.
 Extremely Fine coins will have wear on only the highest points of the design.
 Uncirculated coins will have no wear on the high points of the design at all, though faults in the engraving, or wear on the die, may mean that the design may not be fully struck.

 Under no circumstances should collectible coins be cleaned or polished  this will destroy at least half its' collectible value.

Coming back to your 1862 penny, values for a bog-standard penny in UK Pounds, in Britain, are:

F - GBP 4
VF - GBP 10
EF - GBP 40
UNC - GBP 70

Lower grades are not worth anything much.

Multiply by 1.6 to get a US $ figure, then discount any amount for reduced interest in the coins in the States!

Questions and comments

Ms. Barber wrote: """"In a united effort, the ISSR Licensed Breeders only produce approximately 200 pups per year""""  '''''

Ms. Barber-How many of those puppies were """"produced"""" by your kennel?  What specific health testing do you conduct on your dogs?

You, and those supporting your club/registry, have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests, while appearing rude, insulting, superior-minded, and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you """"founded"""" and the other breeders affiliated with your registry.  I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do, as I can't imagine anyone with any intelligence and self-esteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior, much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.

You claim a lot, but you provide no independent support for your claims, only your own writings on your own website.  You claim anyone """"producing"""" dogs other than you or your registry are frauds, yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings, as evidence. You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are """"in it for the money"""", yet you ignore the fact that:

You produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined, through your wholly and co-owned breeding dogs.  Your website (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/upcoming_litters.htm) for this Winter alone, shows you are """"producing"""" ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through co-ownership breedings.  Eleven litters, even conservatively speaking, could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES!  And, you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer!  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding!

You charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce ($900-$2500+)and you contractually reserve the right, at your own discretion, to substitute a puppy from a buyer's desired litter to another compatible (again, based on your own determination) litter AFTER the buyer has submitted payment to you. (see: http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm.....""""New Zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equal/higher value that is compatible with your exact requirements"""")

You require your puppy-buyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time of purchase, but you also require them to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights, in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life. 

You have no stated policy on your website page (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm) re: your own commitment to rescue and make/find a home for for any of the puppies/dogs you """"produce"""", should they become unwanted, homeless and/or end up in shelters or abusive situations.

Your """"Policies and Prices"""" make no mention of a contractual requirement or even a suggestion by you (with the signed contractual commitment of your puppy-buyers) to spay/neuter their new """"pets"""", in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs, in general.  I could find nowhere on your website where the horrifying statistics of unwanted/euthanzied dogs in the U.S. (2 million +, including 25% of which are purebred dogs) is responsibly addressed by someone actively promoting and engaged in the proliferation of this explosion.
 
Your website does not list any references, such as recommending/governing affiliations (i.e. Better Business Bureau), approval ratings (i.e. OFA, Penn-Hip, CERF), or other professional organizations to which you belong (ie. American Dog Owner's Association, the the Delta Society [therapy], dog training or agility organizations, etc.), only your own dog club(SSDCA), you own dog registry (ISSR), your own literature (except some very limited information by Dr. Padgett and numerous and righteous religious and biblical quotations).

You are the """"Chairman"""" of the board of directors for your registry's dog club, the SSDCA (which charges for membership and participation in club activities).  There is also no arbitration committee available within this organization to negotiate/override any challenges to your decisions.

You control the ISSR dog registry, which charges puppy owners/breeders numerous fees for numerous types of registration papers and other background information, not to mention also deciding if/when/where/how any breeders in your registry are allowed to breed their dogs.  There is also no arbitration committee available within this organization to negotiate/override",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Toa Nidhiki05. I saw that. It's ironic that one of the reasons given for blocking me was my suggestion of bad faith on the part of the left-wingers in the Libertarianism talk page, when they demonstrate blatant bad faith at every turn - one of them is a pathological liar who cannot be reasoned with on any level, another is an obsessed stalker who went on a 24+ hour Wikipaedia marathon to hound my every move until I was blocked, and the other one is just plain batty.

Looking at the editing Histories of Goethena/Propol
For the interested parties that are watching this talk page and article, it would 
be useful to look at the nature and tone of edits which  and 
 have done in the last few weeks and judge the loving kindness they
impart on the Duckworth article, vers the near libelous editing on the Roskam article.

This just pointing out """"facts"""" and not in volition of WP:AGF in quoting that policy it says...

This policy does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary. Actions inconsistent with good faith include vandalism, sockpuppetry, and lying. Assuming good faith also does not mean that no action by editors should be criticized, but instead that criticism should not be attributed to malice unless there is specific evidence of malice. Accusing the other side in a conflict of not assuming good faith, without showing reasonable supporting evidence, is another form of failing to assume good faith.

So, any honest hearted admin, in light of the John Seigenthaler, Sr Debacle, will not
surely not allow the kind of bias editing that now taking place.  So, in the mean time, and until there is some ruling tendered from higher athority, I will lovingly protect the Roskam article as   and  lovingly protect the Duckworth article from any, and all negative edits, even edits that are well cited, per wikipedia policy, I will do the same for the Roskam article.  

Again, I am willing for dialog with other editors regarding good faith edits, but the two editors which I have mentioned above, due again, to their well documented editing histories on the Duckworth and Roskam, I will revert most of what they put up unless those edits conform, IMHO, to Wikipolicy to WP:BLP  WP:NPOV  WP:NPOV#Undue weight.  and finely  WP:SENSE.

 Proposed Edits to New 'Section 3.1' - Timeline, 1875-1925

The roots of IBM date back the the 1880s, decades before the development of electronic computers. The company was formed through a merger of three different companies: the Tabulating Machine Company (with origins in Washington, D.C. in the 1880s), the International Time Recording Company (founded 1900 in Endicott), and the Computing Scale Corporation (founded 1901 in Dayton, Ohio, USA)..  The merger was engineered by noted financier Charles Flint, and the new company was called the Computing Tabulating Recording (CTR) CorporationMartin Campbell-Kelly and William Aspray, Computer a History of the Information Machine — Second Edition, Westview Press, pages 37–39 2004. CTR was incorporated on June 16 1911 in Endicott, New York, U.S.A.. Flint remained a member of the board of CTR until his retirement in 1930.

The companies that merged to form CTR manufactured a wide range of products, including employee time-keeping systems, weighing scales, automatic meat slicers, coffee grinders, and most importantly for the development of the computer, punched card equipment. The product lines were very different, but Flint believed that since they all focused on equipment that made businesses more efficient, there were synergies and cross selling opportunities to be had.  Based in New York City, the new company had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Ontario.

Of the companies merged to form CTR, the most technologically significant was the Tabulating Machine Company, founded by Herman Hollerith, and specialized in the development of punched card data processing equipment. Hollerith's series of patents on tabulating machine technology, first applied for in 1884, drew on his work at the U.S. Census Bureau from 1879–82. Hollerith was initially trying to reduce the time and complexity needed to tabulate the 1890 Census. His development of punch cards in 1886 set the industry standard for the next 80 years of tabulating and computing data input. officemuseum.com – early Hollerith history, with good photographs of period equipment

The Tabulating Machine Company originally sold some machines to a railway company but quickly focused on the challenges of the largest statistical endeavor of its day - the 1900 US Census. After winning the government contract, and completing the project with amazing speed, Hollerith was faced with the challenge of sustaining the company in non-Census years He returned to targeting private businesses both in the United States and abroad, attempting to identify industry applications for his automatic punching, tabulating and sorting machines. But creating markets for the new technology was a struggle, and by 1911 Hollerith, now 51 and in failing health, was looking to rest on his laurels. He sold the business to  Flint for $2.3 million (of which Hollerith got $1.2 million), who then created C-T-R. Hollerith remained involved with C-T-R for some years as a consultant, but his involvement waned as time went on.

When the diversified businesses of C-T-R proved difficult to manage, Flint turned for help to the former No. 2 executive at the National Cash Register Company, Thomas J. Watson Sr.. Watson became General Manager of C-T-R in 1914 and President in 1915. I Drawing upon his managerial experience at NCR, Watson quickly implemented a series of effective business tactics: generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen, and an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker. As the sales force grew into a highly professional and knowledgeable arm of the company, Watson focused their",0,0,0,0,0,0

Image Tagging Image:Nadia04.jpg

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Nadia04.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Vandalism is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia. The most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor, page blanking, or the insertion of nonsense into articles.

Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated. Not all vandalism is obvious, nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism. Careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial, detrimental but well intended, or outright vandalism.

Committing blatant vandalism violates Wikipedia policy. If you find that another user has vandalized Wikipedia, you should revert the changes and warn the user (see below for specific instructions). Users who vandalize Wikipedia repeatedly, despite warnings to stop, should be reported to Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism, and administrators may block them.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Colin, it is good to hear from you!! I have had a lot of real life stuff piling up lately and haven't had a lot of time to contribute lately. I took a look at the Rubella article.

You invited me to edit a page and I did, so it is NOT """"DISRUPTION""""!  If you don;t want it edited, DON'T MAKE IT EDITABLE!

My notability is verifiable on the Web, and off.  I cited STARRRING in a  American/Canadian film, in the very famous  """"Amityville"""" series, and am noted in many places on the Web as its star.

I also cited several a major North American newspaper, the Montreal Gazette (founded by Benjamin Franklin, and the largest English language daily west of Toronto).  You were also told that I have been a critic for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (but YOU wouldn't know what that is, you ignorant AMERICAN, WOULD YOU?).

I ALSO HAVE NUMEROUS OTHER MAJOR CREDITS, BUT HAVE NOT LISTED THEM.

Obviously, you are discriminating against prominent Canadians, because you can't be bothered doiong researching outside of the Internet, or your own, self-important *&*^$%ng country.  

MY article was DISRUPTED by an """"editor"""" who admits she, herself, was cautioned by Wikipedia.

Here's some news for you, *BInky*:  Wikipedia is so """"notable"""" it is NOT EVEN LISTED in the Britannica 2007.

 'Lost Ones' And Jay's relationship with Beyonce 

The article says that """"Many fans disputed this analysis, claiming that the song references a previous relationship with actress Rosario Dawson and that her burgeoning career ended the romance."""" 
That's not what I heard. I read somewhere that the verses were about Beyonce but from years earlier. at the time of Kingdom Come, Beyonce was 25, but the verses refer to the girl being 23. This shows that the verse was written after the black album, and could have been used for Kingdom come. They are clearly back together in Kindom Come, and the song could have been from a rough patch in '04-'05. Both theories are possible and should be included in the article

 This article does not need a list of """"my favourite language"""", but at the same time it does need true examples. Not as language samples, but as examples of what a Hello World program looks like, for the benefit of the general principle. Readers of this article need to see what such a program looks like, and (most importantly) why one would bother. Hello World in JavaScript is trivial - why would any programmer even care to write it?  It makes much more sense for more difficult languages like assembler.
 My edit was to re-add examples for JavaScript, Java and Assembler. I have no particular attachment to these languages but JavaScript is contemporary and as simple as it gets, Java is contemporary and demonstrates how a modern language might still need to be more verbose. Assembler is obscure these days, but it highlights just how much work can still be needed to get Hello World up and running. I believe these three limited examples convey something of value at the level of a general article on Hello World and thus belong here.
 You also removed the note on the Arduino and the use of non-text output devices in the Hello World context. Why?

Okay, I'm going to try and explain this to you again.  There are a few points which you don't seem to be understanding, so I'm going to number them.
Infoboxes contain links to various sites which contain information.  For instance, an actor's infobox will often contain a link to their official web site as well as a link to their IMDb profile.  These are not meant as sources or references.  They are simply links to other reference type sites which are well known for their content as it relates to actors.  The reason that they are included is summed up on WP:EL which states in part """"... information that could not be added to the article for reasons such as copyright or amount of detail, or other meaningful, relevant content...""""  IMDb and IAFD go into a great amount of detail which we don't include.  This is why they are linked in the infobox.
IMDb, much like IAFD, cannot be used as a source for biographical information.  This is because there is little, if any, fact checking done for that information.  For instance, for my IMDb profile (yes, I have one and no, I will not share it with you since it has my real name), I could supply IMDb with a date of birth, ethnicity, and so on and claim to be me but they don't actually know that I am who I say I am.  The filmography on my profile though is supplied by the directors, production companies, etc. which have had me work for them on their films.  Filmographies come to IMDb from official sources.  IAFD works much the same.  Biographical information is not very well fact checked and comes from the average user/reader/whatever you want to call them.  Filmography info comes from the production companies.
You keep asking me for a source.  I don't have any other source than what is already supplied in the article.  If you go to Bitoni's article and look at the ethnicity in the infobox, you'll see a little number """"2"""" next to it.  That number refers to a reference in the references section of the article.  When you look there, you'll see that all the references are numbered.  Click on the second reference and that is the page that is being used as a reference for her ethnicity.  The """"a, b, c"""" that you see there means that the same source is being used for two other facts within the article.
That source is from Bitoni's publicist.  It's as credible as can be and is trusted.
There, now that I've explained all of this, do you have any questions?  If so, please explain which point you don't understand.  |(talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the """"tradecraft"""" used to collect this information.
Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says """"Hey Balls get ready for a patry"""" Balls replies """"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  

History
Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/

The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.

Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU
 ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. 

Various Forms
Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.

The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web

The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,
D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”
Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,
a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,
the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.
The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,
USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there in
October 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.
“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”
Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th century’s greatest mysteries.
Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wife
team, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,
they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2,000 feet of ocean.
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned by
Gillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:
“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [on
Nikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report
“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to search
Nikumaroro.”
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.
“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flying
southeast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missed
Howland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”
This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’t
impressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition that
can be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last message
as ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’
Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart never
saw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, related
no reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...
We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, a
compass course or line of position 157-337, which terminates
on the island of Saipan.1
With Our Own Eyes
– 163 –
– 164 –
Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.
If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,
one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, would
have been communicating. He would have guided their
plane on a pre-arranged course, and calculated for accuracy
during intervals of the flight.2

 Definition of Managment Consulting 

I've modified the paragraph discussing the types of firms to use the more narrow term """"strategy consulting"""" rather than """"management consulting"""".

Managment consulting currently has a very broad meaning.  IT, intellectual property management, law, and accounting all involve choices that can have a profound effect on the opportunities and resources of an organization.  In current usage it seems that the term """"management consulting"""" refers to any sort of consulting activity that

 has strategic implications for the future
 requires senior or upper level managment champions and buy in

To distinguish a Bain from a PWC we need to focus on difference between strategy and implementation.  Strategic IT, strategic IP management, and management accounting and other """"new"""" forms of consulting all have a blend of implementation and strategy in common.

I think what distinguishes a Bain from a PWC is Bain's exclusive focus on the strategic elements of a problem.  Bain will tell you why you need to do something and some general ideas of how given your current resources but leave the rest to you.  Firms like PWC and  Proudfoot have built their reputation on taking at least joint responsibility for the implementation.

Generally, the work is pretty easy, but i do have a problem with certain businesses, musuems, parks, and other minor things.  They don't specifically belong to of the working groups I made, and I am very reluctant to begin new working groups because there are already way too many.  The education group, which is shaping up nicely is a bit overloaded.  I'm trying to decide if I should group all the museums under them or not.  Musuems may also be categorized under buildings and structures and therefore architecture, and some of them can fall under History.  I made a proto-list at List of museums in Greater St. Louis which seems like a useful place to work from, but should I really make a museums working group?

Critiques of the new front page
IMO, the new page looks a lot better than the old one.  However, it's getting a little cluttered.  I think we should avoid the """"web-portalish"""" look (i.e. a painfully overwhelming layout; visit http://www.lycos.com/ for an example).  I would reduce the amount of text in the """"Featured article""""/""""In the news"""" to 75% of what it is now.   06:59, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I like the new front page!
Congrats on the new-look main page - much more professional looking!  20:11, 23 Feb 2004 (UTC)
 Good.  I was afraid to be de-sysadmined when I brought it live!   20:13, 2004 Feb 23 (UTC)

 You are wrong. You will see.
 We have a lot of sysops, right? Some of all those can easily fix & update the mainpage at times they just feel like it. (talk) 21:33, 23 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Too much scrolling
I prefer the old frontpage, there you could see all the 'in the news', 'recent additions', 'featured pages', etc. categories at once. And it was just half a page of scrolling to the bottom. Now the frontpage is too large - once can't see all the 'changing' categories at once.  11:44, Feb 24, 2004 (UTC)

Second this comment. I do not want the chief Wikipedia presentation (seen by everyone) to look just like some commercial web page. It should fit on a single (nominal) screen.

Yes, the cited FAQ page is amazingly weak. We've covered this many times before - just look up """"dildo"""" in the Talk archives.  Why dildo?

Congratulations! You win the """"Head Up Your Ass"""" award for being the zillionth person to read one stupid disinformation FAQ about anarchism and think they know it all. FYI, anarchism means:
""""a political theory holding all forms of governmental authority to be unnecessary and undesirable and advocating a society based on voluntary cooperation and free association of individuals and groups"""" Merriam-Webster
""""The theory or doctrine that all forms of government are oppressive and undesirable and should be abolished"""" American Heritage College Dictionary
""""doctrine rejecting government: an ideology that rejects the need for a system of government in society and proposes its abolition"""" Encarta World English Dictionary

I am allowed to watermark images with anything whatsoever I wish to, even if it's a contradiction, and if you wish me to use up further WP  bandwidth by re-uploading them, that has no effect on me.

It wasn't vandalism; I used an external link as per your instructions, which incidentally I'm not bound to follow. I am certainly on the verge of requesting mediation, as you are disrupting my life, never mind WP, to make a point. I will tell you one more time: any images are better than none. If you wish to get your own pix of all the concerned images, you're damn welcome to try, but they are GFDL therefore there's no grounds for removal. (talk|email) 
PS - I shall add the external link again, not as an image, and if you remove it I shall make a formal complaint to the Wikimedia Foundation, and the Information Commissioner in London. (talk|email) 

, your conduct is a little off in this matter. While I'm all for discussing the issues with users, let's keep it civil please? Thanks.  (talk) 

 I disagree, Rob - it is far more than """"a little"""" off. Images watermarked as such are not in any way appropriate for Wikipedia. This is an encyclopædia, not a pet image project. If """"TheDoctor10"""" isn't happy to play ball, he can go elsewhere.

I edit from the United Kingdom, and under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act, the editing of information online is illegal, without permission. The button at the top of every page that says """"Edit this page"""", among other things, constitutes that permission, while the policies and guidelines form conditions. Since there is no condition against my image, it has a legal right to be there. Q.E.D. (talk|email) 
True, but therefore your addition fails under the same logic. Also, Wikimedia own the servers, it's their right to delete it. 13ID:540053 
Apologies to Ed for invading his talk page, but what a load of rubbish! Wikipedia are under no legal obligation whatsoever to host your images, regardless of whether they meet any policy. I have no idea under what flawed logic you presume that the fact you can edit Wikipedia means that your edits must legally be accepted. If the Computer Misuse Act states that the editing of information online is illegal without permission, that implies that editing with permission is legal, and nothing more. Furthermore, by your logic, I have the legal right to edit Wikipedia, and remove your images...

 Here is a little something that I came up with myself

Let the boxes equal the letters A-V
Let the prize that you want to win be behind box A (It doesn't matter which box the prize you want to win is in, [also assume biggest prize])
Now if you pick box A, then the probability of getting through to the end of the game with the prize you want still in the game is 1(certain).
This occurs is (1/22) cases.
(1)*(1/22)=(1/22)

If you don't pick box A then the probability of you getting to the end of the game without taking out the prize you want is:

(20/21)*(19/20)*(18/19)... *(2/3). 

This can be re-written as:

(2*((20!)*(1!)))/(21!).

There is one very important thing to note here. In the sum, you don't multiply by 1/2, because you don't need to eliminate all of the boxes, just all but one (plus yours). This means that instead of dividing by (21!), you must divide by (21!)/(2) which is why there is a 2* on the top.

The sum works out with a value of (2/21) = 0.9523809524
This occurs is 21/22 cases so:

(21/22)*(2/21)= (1/11)

Therefore, you are twice as likely to be on the path where you didn't pick the prize you wanted (i.e. grand) first, which means that you should swap. Now there may be a flaw in my logic, and if there is then please point it out.82.26.43.91  15:46",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Plot: 

The film opens with Lord Voldemort stealing the Elder wand from Albus Dumbledore's tomb and shooting a large bolt of lightning into the sky. It then cuts to Hogwarts which is no longer a colorful castle of magic, but a shadowy concentration camp surrounded by Dementors with the students being marched through the Entrance Courtyard. Severus Snape stands in the top of the castle and watches the students with a blank expression.
At Shell Cottage, Harry Potter sits in front of Dobby's grave, gazing into the one way mirror. He suspects that there is a Horcrux in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts so he, Ron and Hermione strike a deal with Griphook: he will get them into Gringotts Wizarding Bank to find the Horcrux if they give him the Sword of Gryffindor, a bargain to which they reluctantly agree. Harry then questions Ollivander, who examines and identifies the stolen wands of Bellatrix Lestrange and Draco Malfoy. While he confirms that Draco's wand is safe to use, he cautions Harry about Bellatrix's wand, as it is """"unyielding"""" and might be dangerous unless its allegiance has changed. Harry then asks him if he knows about the Deathly Hallows and Ollivander claims he does not think they exist, although Harry knows he told Voldemort about the Elder Wand and is determined to kill Voldemort first.

With Harry and Griphook under the Invisibility Cloak, Hermione disguised as Bellatrix and Ron as a foreign wizard with bushy facial hair, the trio and Griphook apparate to Gringotts. During the first phase of the mission Harry and Ron are forced to use the Imperius Curse on Bogrod to cover up Hermione's unsuccessful impersonation of Bellatrix. They manage to get into the vault despite their disguises being removed by The Thief's Downfall, and inside the vault they find Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, the Horcrux, but set off the Geminio curse, causing everything they touch to multiply exponentially. Griphook takes the sword from them after they get the cup, saying that he never said he would help them get out, only in. He runs for it and calls security, the trio are almost crushed by the gold and captured but Hermione gets them to jump on the back of a dragon kept as a security measure. Setting the dragon free, it wreaks havoc killing several goblins (including Bogrod), crashing through the roof and flying off with the trio on its back. After jumping off the dragon into a lake, Harry has a vision of Voldemort furiously killing Griphook and many other Gringotts employees and personnel at Malfoy Manor for allowing his Horcrux to get stolen. Choosing to keep Nagini by his side, he summons his followers and orders them to invade Hogwarts to ensure the Horcrux he hid there is still safe.

Having sensed Voldemort thinking of his Horcrux and Hogwarts through their connection, Harry tells the other two they have to go there and destroy it before Voldemort can get to it, and that Voldemort seems to be getting more fragile with each Horcrux destroyed. They apparate to Hogsmeade but immediately trigger alarms set up by Death Eaters, waiting for Harry. The trio are almost captured but Aberforth Dumbledore gets them safely into his home and berates them for coming to the village. Harry discovers that it was him who had been watching them through the mirror shard and him who sent Dobby to rescue them before after seeing the Two-Way mirror hung up on the wall. Aberforth provides them with food and tells them to give up on their mission, go into hiding and save themselves. Harry said that he trusts Dumbledore's judgement that the task has to be seen through no matter what, but Aberforth insists that Albus had left them a suicide mission and it was hopeless. After Harry insisted on finishing what he had started, Aberforth summoned Neville Longbottom through a secret passage behind Ariana's portrait to bring them into Hogwarts. Bruised and beaten by the Death Eaters of the staff, Neville and most of the students have been hiding in the Room of Requirement all year. They welcome Harry in with tremendous applause and jump at the idea of helping Harry finish Voldemort but Harry still doesn't know what the Horcrux looked like or where it was. After saying it might be connected to Ravenclaw, Luna suggests that Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem might be it, despite no one alive today having seen it. Ginny arrives and after gazing at Harry for a moment tells everyone that Snape was now aware of Harry's break in and wanted everyone in the Great Hall.

In the hall, Snape orders anyone who may hold information regarding Harry's location to tell him immediately or face punishment. Harry then reveals himself after hiding within the crowd and rebukes Snape for standing where Dumbledore once stood as Headmaster, ordering him to tell the students the truth of how he betrayed and killed Dumbledore as Order Of The Phoenix members enter the Great Hall.

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!

 Problem with the Fundamentals Discussion - This Was Already Erased Please Investigate 

( minutes after posting this it was erased) check it out. this is very suspicious and unethical by the parties involved. senior management (if in existence) asked to investigate)

````Please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article.
Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts. Additionally, the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the President o",0,0,0,0,0,0

Removing some wiki links from """"External Links"""" section (These links are irrelevant to post-disco): a Hi-NRG link and Italo Disco link. In fact, Post-disco influenced italo-disco in beginnings, but italo-disco is other class music. Taking it all, Italo-disco link you can find in infobox, in """"Derivative forms"""" segment.   

 Dance-rock redirection 

I change the dance-rock redirection, from dance music to  [[Post-disco#Dance-Rock]] . From actual-point-of-view , Dance-Rock can not have its own article, because of its sources. Dance-Rock's only source is All Music Guide, so there can be a WP:V problem. Anyway, Google finds """"nothing"""" (only just irrelevant pages), except.. yes AMG and Last.fm. However, some remarking have page of Billboard magazine from 2004.

I also created Dance-Rock redirect.   

AllMusic source
This article is one of a number of music genre articles that were created solely using AllMusic as a source, and for which few other sources seemed to be available. I'd rather have just deleted it, but decided instead to trim and rephrase it so that it was perfectly clear that elevating the term """"post-disco"""" to genre status was apparently an attempt to fill a gap in AllMusic's taxonomy of genres, and that it was the creation of a now-uncredited individual author who was paid to write it. Also I wanted to show the author never really defined it as a musical style; it wasn't ever established how it was related to disco on one end and house music on the other.

Recently the article has been expanded to cite other mentions of """"post-disco"""". I'm fine with that, but I'm not convinced every use of the term was really intended to be interpreted as a genre name. I'm just afraid this article is doing the exact same thing the AllMusic blurb did: trying too hard to give traction to a name for something that really didn't have a name, or that perhaps was only called """"boogie"""". I feel like I'd rather see a section of the Boogie article devoted to the dance music genre than to continue down the road of searching for vague references to dance music in the post-disco era as evidence of an accepted genre name. —  
My opinion is that post-disco is also genre (""""boogie""""), but also a movement, but that's WP:POV. I don't know.. I mean I don't understand what's really """"post-disco"""" (after disco era / boogie genre ?) means at all. If it is """"era"""" so all tracks to present is """"post-disco"""", but if it is a genre... (unsourced; only AMG and some kind of sites like """" danceclassics.net"""" etc).   

 OR & source misrepresentation in lead: analysis 

None of the cited sources other than Allmusic suggest that """"post-disco"""" is a genre. Many of the citations are also WP:SPS.

The term post-disco (or simply boogie) has multiple meanings. Citation does not support the assertion that """"post-disco"""" has multiple meanings or that it is a term interchangeable with Boogie

Sometime after 1990,AMG was founded in 1991 —  an Allmusic editorial contributor used """"post-disco"""" in an attempt to isolate a dance music genre in the era between the indistinct """"end"""" of disco music and the equally indistinct emergence of house music. Proposition unsupported by a third party verifiable source, this is editorial analysis therefore WP:OR

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of: 1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality). 2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree. 3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times. 6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

 Hakan Mild 

Hi Johan. Why do you keep deleting the link to video featuring Hakan Mild?? You write, """"it's irrelevant to the article"""". Great, if the article was about Nuclear Power Plant, I'd say too, the video about great Swedish football player Hakan Mild, showing his AMAZING skills with the ball, is irrelevant to the topic. But the article about Mild... so what's wrong with the video about the very guy the article is written about, Johan?? ) Seriously, I wonder why do you delete it. Please, think again, let's put a link to the video so all the people who visit this Wikipedia page (and Wikipedia's pages are first to be found in all search engines, so everyone who likes to know more about Hakan Mild, would visit this page first) would see an amazing skills of the guy. If I could, I'd add more videos to that section, videos that feature his goals, for example, that great goal he scored when Sweden beat Bulgaria 4-0 in 1994 (over the 3rd place, I bet you remember). Other pages DO HAVE this link section with the link to videos. So why wouldn't we?? 
P.S. Mind you that it is NOT my video neither I want to promote it in such way. I'm simply a big fan of Sweden, Swedish football and everything that's connected to the fame of your incredibly beautiful country.85.250.39.107  Ronnie Slogun, 5 Dec 2007, 7:41 PM.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks for uploading or contributing to File:030723 202314-179 RebZali1big.jpg.

Please go to the file description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

Proposed Merger
I have proposed a number of mergers for articles and have placed the following text on the talk pages. I thought it might be beneficial if any general discussion took place on this page.

""""The article is not likely to progess much beyond a stub. I would suggest merging into a single page for minor characters set out in a similar way to other shows such as List of recurring characters from The Simpsons or Characters of Lost.

 An except of analysis from the """"supposed"""" unreliable source 

www.zimbeckchess.com
IT IS A RELIABLE SOURCE. Here is the analysis which I was simply trying to source from the page itself. Some of this is already in UON could I source that instead for the EXACT SAME CHANGE? My site, which is my lifes work as a master was deemed unreliable by non-chess players. Here is the analysis in regards to the pinksi line.
These guys wont understand it because chess is too complicated for them but lets us hope that some other strong player who cares about how low quality wikipedia chess articles are will come by and confirm that my add was reliable instead of these random non-chess players burying it in revisions. This is a public outcry for any sign of intelligent life.

Here is the analysis of the Pinski line which even a beginner should understand. This is FROM THE SITE Zimbeckchess.com which was called unreliable. Will someone please get rid of this dusty Pinksi line already?

Here it is with HOUDINI annotations and evaluations. Or is Houdini not WP:RS?

6... Bb4 7. dxc6 Nxe4 8. Qd4 Qe7 9. Be3 
       (9. Qxg7?? Nxc3+ 10. Be3 Ne4+ 11. c3 Rf8 12. cxb4 Qxb4+ 13. Kd1 dxc6 14. f3 Be6! -+)

(not 12... Bg5? 13. O-O! {black is in trouble there according to Houdini}) 

Thus, the analysis on this page is a lie with one players opinion inserted. 
www.zimbeckchess.com is where this was sourced. It was deemed unreliable because the random guy that edited wanted to war with me because he did not like what I said when I said I felt the Halloween was """"Playable"""". Don't dare play this line anyone! Someone will play this dusty Kaufman line and win a pawn by force!!! Kaufman the all knowing all seeing eye atop the pyramid and Euwe and 100 year old player who would not even be able to beat my laptop in chess. Beware the innocuous PINSKI REFUTATION THAT IS NOT REALLY A REFUTATION

Maybe if I was Carlsen this guy would stop undoing my edits and saying my """"personal website"""" was unreliable. Or maybe not! Maybe Carlsen can not edit Wikipedia. Maybe this is Carlsen in disguise!! Think of how many people RELY on wikipedia. People RELY on experts in their fiedls. But what happens when the experts get ignored?! I guess my master title in chess is toilet paper. So are my chess puzzles. My """"self-published"""" book is probably garbage. Maybe I should delete my """"personal"""" website because its not Krabbes site which this guy likes better because he likes Krabbe better than Zimbeck. In his eyes, judging Zimbeck by one comment made about the opening being playable. What this guy does not know, is theory changes and thats why they call it theory. OR ELSE WE SHOULD JUST CLOSE THIS PAGE AND ALLOW NOBODY TO EDIT IT BECAUSE IT MUST BE FACT!!! AFTER ALL SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO PLAY CHESS THINKS A DUSTY PINSKI LINE REFUTES THE ENTIRE OPENING AND IT DOES NOT EVEN ENGAGE IN THE SACRIFICE. IT JUST GIVES THE PIECE BACK LIKE A COWARD AND GETS THE WORLDS MOST BORING POSITIONS THAT ARE ALL 0.00 ACCORDING TO HOUDINI.

Speedy deletion of Feague
 A tag has been placed on Feague requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Hi Ben! You've recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine. You've correctly tagged them as fair-use/magazine, but I don't think the images are being used under fair-use considerations.

The tag for fair-use/magazines says:

...It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of magazine covers: to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question,...

The images are being used to illustrate programmes, not the TVTimes magazine. Therefore I'd say they're not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia's fair-use copyrights policy.

Additionally, the tag says ...To the uploader: please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use, as described on Wikipedia:Image description page, as well as the source of the work and copyright information. These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don't provide the source of the work (scan, taken from another website etc).

I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles you've put them in, but I'd be interested in hearing your views. Thanks ➨ ❝REDVERS❞

Actually, I can accept trading a 48 hour block for still being allowed to express my feeling towards some of Wikipedia's greatest flaws when it comes to the wiki-police and how it is common for a gang of users to ridicule others without fully studying the facts simply because they do not have the time and/or are enforcing some policy written by the wiki-police. There is a reason newbies are reluctant to become regulars on Wikipedia and most editors that have edited Wikipedia for as long as I have, just basically retire and walk away. What is funny is that during the asteroid re-direct discussions of March and April I was not even around to discuss the consensus that developed. I did not make a single edit to Wikipedia from March 5 to May 1. It will be a great loss to Wikipedia content (vs the wiki-police force and policies) if editors like myself leave because members such as Padenton are allowed to group attack people without bothering to properly look into the facts. Perhaps I should move my near-Earth asteroid work over to a SETI website, but then I would probably have to leave Wikipedia to prevent being further accused of a COI with my edits.

 Article name 

Since 2003 Ukrainian anthem is uses the modified lyrics of Chybynsky. The first stanza is changed to """"Ще не вмерла України"""" instead of """"Ще не вмерла Україна"""". It makes to sense to call the article after this first stanza, since you can't even translate it into English (you need the rest of the stanza for that). That is, by using the 1st stanza as the name (instead of the official name State Anthem of Ukraine) we end up with this: """"Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy"""" (, or """"Ukraine's ? hasn't died""""), where we have to put ? in the sentence. Therefore, the article name should be (and in accordance with the Ukrainian law) State Anthem of Ukraine.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You're talking to the wrong guy. Not only did I not start any editwars. I didn't initiate any personal attacks either, I used the talk page the way it is supposed to be utilized, to initiate discussion on the subject of an influential person to the Church of the SubGenius.

I suppose you are off to edit DooM out of the article on the Columbine Killings as it was released several years before the killings happened and there is no direct causal relationship between it and the killings, only people who claim there is a causal link. Kevin Underwood affected the church. Nearly every member of note has an opinion on the booger, and all you have to do is mention Underwood on the talk page to get swarmed by Church member caretakers and hack attacks (a variety of these have taken place in the last few days while discussing editing the article, from blocking of the page entirely, to abnormal (10 minutes or more) page load times, to apparent deletion of talk points after loading the page.) What you have here is a page zealously defended by a bunch of nuts who are so zealous about their complete disassociation from Underwood despite comments by Church co-creator Ivan Stang regarding him AND conversations with him, that the protestations are evidence themselves of his effect on the Church.

Rename. It's a good idea - as long as it doesn't duplicate the lines already covered in the London Underground list. However, UK Railway Stations 1 isn't the best name.  23:19, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)
Keep - codes are really useful. Could add """"http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldb/summary.aspx?T="""" before each code so that it links to live departure information for each station. E.g. http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldb/summary.aspx?T=WAT would provide info for London Waterloo.

 Help Please! An evil Wikipedia editor attacks aviation pioneers Coanda and Vuia constantly 

Unfortunately, an evil Wikipedia editor (who uses a multitudes of names ( Romanianlies, Romaniantruths, Binksternet, Soundofmusicals, Andy Dingley, GraemeLeggett, BilCat, ... ) and is also in the Bord of Editors, so he has more power on Wikipedia that an ordinary contributor) has been attacking for more than three years various aviation pioneers, amongst others Traian Vuia and Henri Coanda, for unknown reasons. 

In general, as soon as he sees the two names in Wikipedia articles he immediately adds the word """"unsuccessful"""" and other unjustified bad characterizations, multiple times.

Any attempt to delete these unfair remarks always fails and the user who dare to confront Romanianlies gets suspended.

Before i posted this discussion, I asked myself, am I ready for Bdell555's next move, which will be to pretend that the consensus of the editors is not against him, thus requiring me to itemized all the objections?
The issue is, is the article improved by changing the sentence to either of the two versions you have championed, one which shifts it against Hiss, saying """"New evidence has added a variety of information supporting Hiss' guilt"""" or one which states that """"most"""" scholars have concluded Hiss guilty.
One the former, you were specifically criticized by DCGeist and Cberlet.
One the latter, a version of which you are trying to introduce now, KarlBunker came out against it, saying, """"it essentially declares one side of a debate to be the """"winner,"""" and.... It's best for Wikipedia to avoid """"declaring a winner"""" like this unless there's a very clear consensus among scholars.""""
John Z has also specifically criticized you on this change, saying that your version doesn't addresses the concerns of other editors.
So, since I don't think we need to debate RedSpruce's position, we still come up with the same score:

Number of editors who have commented endorsing the change: JUST YOU.

 Newly Discovered Documentary Evidence That Affects this Article's Accuracy

I have recently found a 1979 booklet of questions and answers with Rawat printed and distributed by Divine Light Mission, Inc. which bears heavily on some of the issues central to this article.  This document was published at least five years after the family split, seven or eight years after Rawat came to the west and when he was either 21 or 22 years old.  In other words, at the time he uttered these statements, he was an adult who was long familiar with western culture, spoke good English and was very much his own man.  Here are a few of the questions and answers:

Some people say you are a divine incarnation, and some people say other things about you.  What's the truth?

You yourself must realize what is the truth.

So God cannot teach anything, except through a Master?

What is God?  You don't know what God is.  God cannot be a human being.  God is Light.  God is Power.  God cannot talk.  Electricity cannot give light, only the bulb gives light, but electricity has to be put through the wire for the bulb to give light.  It's power.  Power cannto do anything.  It has to be put through a medium.

Why does a Perfect Master have to have a living body to give Knowledge?  Why is he necesssary?

Are you feeling thirsty?  Can you see that photo of Lord Shiva?  You see the water coming out from the top of his head?  Drink that water.  Drink, drink.  Can you?  You can't drink that water.  It is a picture.  You need everything living.  If you have doubts, you cannot ask Lord Krishna questions.  What's why you need a living Master for the circumstances of this world today.  When Jesus was here there were no nuclear bombs.  But now there are nuclear bombs, and the Perfect Master, the Perfect Savior [sic], has come to save you from nuclear bombs.

Is the living Master able to reveal Knowledge?

Yes, that's why you call him a living Master. 

Guru Maharaj Ji, Jesus Christ performed many cures.  Can you do the same?

At His time there were not so many doctors, that's why he did that.  But I am curing mental sickness.  If you have got mental sickness, come to me.  And when you do meditation, you become so natural that any other diseases you have are automatically cured.  That's why I tell you this Knowledge is very practical.  It makes people natural.  They stop being plastic.  They become natural and the best way of ending disease is by nature.

What happens to a person's karma when they receive Knowledge?

It starts choking up. It starts finishing up, because when you realize Knowledge, you've got to go and be one with God.

Will this Knowledge save us from rebirth?

Yes.  Once we have this Knowledge we reach the heaven from where we cannot return.  

Guru Maharaj Ji, are you permanently in God consciousness?

......[torn page] ...permanently in God consciousness.  

The lower part of the last page in the book is intact and it's a quote that reads:

""""I have found that missing link.  As soon as I found that missing link, I became one with everything.  And therefore I became everything.  Not as an individual but by merging into that infinite thing which has no beginning, which has no end, which cannot be destroyed.  And I have that for you to experience.""""

He signs this last quote:

""""Guru Maharaj Ji""""

I maintain that there are several aspects of the article that need to be corrected or, at minimum, balanced by this evidence.  For instance, it flies in the face of the 1999 quotation from Rawat's then-website wherein he said:

People through the years have tried to place me in a mold, and from the very early years I have not been able to oblige them. When I was very young, people were looking for the """"old silver-haired Guru with flowing white robes."""" I was only eight. When people were flocking to India for their search, I was in the West. When people were looking for sophisticated discourses, I spoke of simple things. When people wanted nirvana, I said, """"You need peace."""" When people said, """"Tell us of the scriptures,"""" I said, """"Look within you."""" When people asked, """"What is your qualification?"""" I said, """"Judge me by what I offer."""" To this day, some people see me the way they want to. After all, I guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are. I have evolved, but my message stays the same. Externally, I have changed but within me, something stays the same. 

Long after Rawat was """"only eight"""" he was playing games about whether or not he was God, he was saying that the reason he doesn't cure people like Jesus did is because we have lots of doctor",0,0,0,0,0,0

As to RoyBoy, he is not very good at checking his facts. Even a cursory Google would show that Jonathan Sarfatti and Jack Sarfatti are not the same person and live on different continents. Notice how silent the Great Mathematician Dr. Hillman is in the light of Nobel Prize physicist Brian Josephson's remark above putting him in his proper place and in Hillman's inability to respond to Sarfatti's detailed argument above. It is not enough to bluster """"it's nonsense"""". Burinski will also respond he is not on e-mail all the time. None of your facts check out. Everything Sarfatti has said is the truth and his arguments on the physics have not been refuted. You people not only have no respect for truth, you simply cannot even perceive it because this information is too advanced for all of you - even Chris Hillman who is not a physicist although he is a mathematician of sorts - he admits he is not even interested in quantum theory so he should recuse himself if he were really honest. Brian Josephson wrote the reality above.

Quote """"We use the term ‘Grand Alliance’ or ‘Allies’ to describe an activated military alliance in WW1 that included Japan and Italy, and again use the term ‘Allies’ to describe on group in WW2 that does NOT include Japan and Italy. Not a big deal, except of course you can tell the ‘anti-Japanese’ wikipedia sites here because they do not mention Japan as a member of the ‘Allies’ despite it being and undisputed historical fact by English and Japanese historians. how I see it used in Asian history books""""

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? Italy did change sides in WWII and a co-belligerent state supporting the allies established but the RSI was also set up a state in the North, however Japan was NEVER part of the allies in World War II! As for JAPANESE historians and history books – haven’t you heard about Japanese history textbook controversies .  

In WWI, Brazil declared war on Germany in 1917, however there was never any formal alliance signed between Brazil and the Entente, the Triple entente wasn’t even a formal alliance, but an agreement – there was a unity agreement, however that stated that they would not seek a separate peace with Germany. Britain only declared war on Germany after it invaded Belgium and the United States declared war on Germany and Austria Hungary in 1917 yet not on Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire. They are called allies because they were ‘’united for a common purpose’’ - the defeat of Germany and or of the Central Powers as a whole, American industrial strength in terms of munitions and armaments also bolstered the British, French and other allies.   
In WWII, the ALLIES were overall fighting a common enemy at one point in time, and had a common purpose. SOME countries declared war yet did not send personnel to fight but assisted in the the allies in economic or other forms(severing relations etc.).       

Allies amd Axis
The Allies were those countries that joined together in an association against Germany then later Italy and Japan and those countries/movements associated with them(the Axis). In the beginning – Britain and it’s Commonwealth/Empire, France etc. and later countries that joined them against these powers including the US and Soviet Union and exiled governments. There were tensions between the powers especially Roosevelt - De Gaulle and Churchill/Roosevelt – Stalin, however there was mutual co-operation in the form of lend lease and other agreements. On January 1 1942 all of the belligerents signed a document called the Declaration by United Nations - the parties pledged to uphold the Atlantic Charter, to employ all their resources in the war against the Axis powers, and that none of the signatory nations would seek to negotiate a separate peace with Germany/Japan and the other member of the Axis.
Not all of the countries delcared war on all of the members of the Axis immediately or some not at all – eg.Brazil only declaring war on Japan on 6/61945. Some countries like only declared war on Japan because they entered to late in the war like Chile, other countries like the Norway and Poland declared war on Japan yet they did not contribute forces against Japan. 

A Global War
""""All I am saying is that if we want to portray that period of history accurately, that in the same way we do not include the Finnish Winter War nor the ongoing Chinese Civil War as part of what we call ww2, that we should record there being 2 separate wars: one in the ‘West’(Europe, Mediterranean) and one in the ‘East’(Pacific and East Asia), and therefore 2 separate groups of friends and foes, 2 separate formations of ‘Allies’. Then we also appear more moral historically.""""

""""What I am saying was that the war in Europe and the war in Asia were 2 separate wars. 2 separate groups of alliances. 2 separate military alliances we deliberately, or just simply irresponsibly, confuse by using the same title ‘Allies’ or ‘Grand Alliances’. Once we admit they were 2 separate wars, then it all makes more sense and make us look all the more moral.""""

""""So even today, we use the same title of an alliance to refer to 2 different wars at the very same time, in this case, right next to eachother even. But if you tell a Canadian, German or Hollander etc that they are members of the same ‘coalition’ at war in Iraq, they will take great offense at your ignorance.""""

Simply saying """"We talked about this"""" does not a conversation make. You have not discussed this, or offered any point by point counter to each of the citations, you have simply removed the entire section without edit repeatedly.

The entire paragraph is not a one time edit, it reflects a 10 day edit, revert, discussion, update and citation run that culminated in the final paragraph that is now included. Some late comers finally decided that the entire thing did not suit them and removed it without discussion to the latter section but there was never discussion on the content just the wholesale dismissal and that is not in the spirit of NPOV.

Either please provide a point by point citation level issue with the paragraph or leave it alone until you have had time to cool down and do some research. You say the citations do little to support the content but offer no substantive example to support that. Do some homework, examine black publications and writings within the scope of your research or stand down. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 I dispute Jayjg's block for """"personal attacks"""" 

For the record I dispute Jayjg's block of me for """"personal attacks"""" (and he has yet to notify me on my talk page). Given the history of the Conspiracy theory article it is perfectly reasonable to interpret that a bot-like highly coordinated cabal of editors do everything in their power to defend or implement a certain POV. Why do Jayjg and his POV aligned friends always seem to show up to the same article at the same time? Why do Jayjg and his friends have exactly the same POV? They never seem to debate the core issues of any controversy on the talk page.  T """,0,0,0,0,0,0

ae1518875f85d46e,""":Okay, you want trouble. We have a problem on 4 accounts.

1. You delete information out of disconcern without even TRYING to look for sources yourself.

2. Even dumber, you personally deliver a provacative message to the person who typed the information.

3. You brought up those stupid wikipedia policies as if I'm fucking retard that doesn't know the rules. Honestly, who do you think you're fooling?

4. You brought the unpopular/unfathomable name, """"Jason Anthony Griffith"""" to my talk page which really pisses me off. It's not enough that someone would pull something so stupid as to try to start shit by deleting the info someone types themselves and going to their talk page to gloat about it. 

What the hell are you, some kind of amature? Wikipedia is for people concerned with adding the real facts and nothing but that. Not deleting info and not even giving back more or less HALF as much as what you took away.
We don't need shit like this.
The only reason you absolutely require a source instead of taking the word of the people THEN trying to hide behind wikipedia's stupid policies is because you just want the article to look clean. Well stand by for news, the truth isn't clean and orderly. It doesn't have to be. The one this is all about doesn't agree with the information that WILL still be up? Let Jason Anthony Griffith take it down himself. If not, the truth STAYS up. I don't care what you try and say.

And those sources ARE good enough for that paragraph. Don't delete, try editting. An artivle doesn't need all sources to be deemed accurate.
